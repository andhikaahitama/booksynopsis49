She holds a doctorate in nutrition and is the founder and executive director of the highly esteemed Health Recovery Center in Minneapolis. It was the loss of her seventeen-year-old son to suicide that fueled her search for more effective solutions to emotional healing. Her clinic has now successfully treated several thousand people over a twenty-year period. She lives in Minneapolis.CHAPTER 1<br>It's Not All in Your Mind<br><br>As far back as he could remember, Peter had been fearful, but he covered<br>it up extremely well. Now married, he supported his family adequately but<br>felt shy and joyless most of the time. He drank beer occasionally to<br>offset those feelings. Still, he seemed to become more of a loner with<br>each passing year. Peter never considered himself a candidate to see a<br>psychiatrist. He was simply living out his life of quiet despair until we<br>met.<br><br>Meg was an excellent attorney with a very bright mind. Her facade was<br>take-charge aggressive, and few crossed her. Yet at our first meeting she<br>was in tears because of her angry, erratic behavior. She had no idea why<br>she seemed to exist in a state of such high arousal. . . . This trait was<br>hurting those she loved the most. She wanted to mellow out but knew her<br>career couldn't afford the fog prescription drugs created.<br><br>An exceptional designer, musician, and musical director, Eric didn't have<br>the emotional staying power to ignite his career into high gear. Despite<br>his brilliance, his heart pounded with anxiety during performances. He<br>drank a lot of caffeine and was a heavy smoker. His mood swings left him<br>exhausted when he desperately needed extra energy. Ongoing psychological<br>counseling did not change any of this. . . . Now he was considering taking<br>prescribed drugs to relieve his depression and anxiety. He summed it up<br>the day we met, telling me, at age forty-two, "Some days my life feels<br>entirely hopeless."<br><br>Donna usually felt scattered. Her thinking was foggy, and her problems<br>concentrating were affecting her job. Memories of her childhood were of a<br>pale, listless little girl who had never felt the world was a friendly<br>place. She had had frequent childhood illnesses--earaches, strep throats,<br>and colds. Now as an adult, she still felt fragile. She told me she needed<br>help to overcome her muddled thinking and get some joy in her life. But<br>her number-one priority was finding relief from her fatigue, which made<br>her tired right down to her bones. For Donna, life was an uphill<br>battle--and she was slowly losing the war.<br><br>It is part of the human condition that we keep taking our own inventory<br>and continually come up short, but it becomes a calamity if the missing<br>pieces prevent us from enjoying a fulfilling, stable life. If, like Peter,<br>Meg, Eric, and Donna, you are saying, "I wish I could feel better, think<br>better, perform better," it is time to stop wishing and take heart! This<br>book will change your life.<br><br>Like the case studies just cited, you, too, may be coexisting with an<br>erratic nervous system or brain, and lack the energy, verve, joy, and<br>confidence that are your birthright. Yet you may be hesitant about seeing<br>a therapist. And, in fact, the idea that a good therapist can solve these<br>problems by simply talking to you has been the great bane of the twentieth<br>century! Untold millions are filling the coffers of psychologists and<br>counselors who listen to the tales of misery that such lives produce but<br>aren't able to effect real, positive, lasting changes in their clients.<br><br>Fortunately, in the last few decades, biochemists and medical doctors have<br>begun to pinpoint scientific explanations for behavior that used to be<br>labeled "psychological." These researchers have noticed that:<br><br>* many "psychological" symptoms often cluster in families.<br><br>* certain physical changes in the brain (and body) can create mayhem<br>emotionally.<br><br>* an internal invasion of yeast parasites may create full-blown mental and<br>physical illness.<br><br>* food intolerances strongly affect our emotions.<br><br>* airborne chemicals can alter our brains.<br><br>* angry outbursts are predictable from a brain in a chemical state of high<br>arousal all the time.<br><br>* dozens of biochemical mistakes can result in bleak depression or anxiety.<br><br>All of these are fixable, if we can identify them!<br><br>A New Direction<br><br>In 1896, Sigmund Freud predicted that "the future may teach us to exercise<br>a direct influence by means of chemical substances upon the amounts of<br>energy and their distribution in the apparatus of the mind." By 1927 he<br>had become "firmly convinced that one day all these mental disturbances we<br>are trying to understand will be treated by means of hormones or similar<br>substances." How right he was! Science now knows it can address such<br>"mental disturbances" biochemically. It is no longer believed that talk<br>therapy and good counseling advice can relieve the agony emanating from a<br>chemically disrupted brain.<br><br>In fact, science has now taken off at a gallop in the direction of<br>biochemical repair. One of the leaders in the field is a brilliant<br>Canadian named Abram Hoffer who is both a biochemist and a psychiatrist.<br>In the 1950s, he began to apply pellagra research to psychiatric patients.<br>Earlier, vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency had been established as the cause<br>of pellagra, a disease that causes confusion, disorientation, and memory<br>disturbance. So here was a classic example of a natural substance that<br>prevents a psychotic state. In fact, the prolonged absence of niacin in<br>our bodies will ultimately result in death!<br><br>In 1962, Dr. Hoffer published the first double-blind study in the field of<br>psychiatry. He found that, of ninety-eight schizophrenic patients<br>receiving megadoses of niacin, the hospital readmission rate was 10<br>percent over three years with no suicides, while the placebo group had a<br>50 percent readmission with four suicides. Also in the 1960s, Dr. Hoffer<br>treated about twenty-five former prisoners of war who had been imprisoned<br>in Japanese concentration camps during World War II. He found that, in<br>order to be free of the many physical and psychiatric symptoms (i.e.,<br>fears, anxieties, insomnia, depression) they developed during their<br>internment, 90 percent of the former prisoners had developed a permanent<br>need for large doses of niacin.<br><br>The Canadian Department of Health and Welfare also conducted a study to<br>determine if the general chronic illnesses seen in the men held in<br>Japanese POW camps, who underwent starvation and excessive stress, were<br>present in their brothers who had served in Europe. The differences were<br>remarkable! The men incarcerated by the Japanese suffered from serious<br>ongoing psychiatric and neurological diseases throughout life, as well as<br>heart disease, premature blindness, arthritis, and a high death rate. None<br>of these symptoms was present in their brothers. Clearly, the starvation<br>and stress endured in the Japanese camps had created chronic illness.<br>Fortunately, Dr. Hoffer was able to treat some of these men, extending<br>their lives and saving their sanity with niacin (B3).<br><br>How Nutrient Deprivation Cripples Us Emotionally<br><br>You may not see a connection between starving prisoners and our own poorly<br>functioning health, but as you read on you will begin to understand how<br>physical deprivation can trigger uncontrollable emotional behavior, all<br>the way to madness. I expect many of you are protesting that you are not<br>starving, by any means! But because of your unique, individual biochemical<br>requirements or because of some glitches in how you absorb nutrients, or<br>the fact that you live on junk food and colas, your brain may never get<br>enough of what it needs. Then you are in the same boat as the young men I<br>am about to describe:<br><br>During World War II, scientists in the United States also pondered the<br>effects of starvation on captured GIs living in Japanese POW camps. To<br>provide some answers, a six-month study was launched at the University of<br>Minnesota using healthy young male conscientious objectors. This study<br>produced incredible results (although, of course, this kind of study would<br>not be conducted today).<br><br>The young men were deprived of more than half their normal food intake.<br>Over the course of six months, many suffered severe physical and<br>psychiatric changes, and most of these disturbances lingered long after<br>the experiment had ended.<br><br>In the beginning, the men showed a high degree of tolerance and<br>sociability with each other. But gradually they began to avoid group<br>activities. There were frequent outbursts of anger and irritability, and<br>many grew deeply depressed. Some finally required hospitalization in a<br>psychiatric ward. One chopped off three of his fingers in response to<br>stress; another became uncontrollably violent. Many expressed the fear<br>that they were going crazy; others talked of suicide. They all cried a lot<br>and displayed wild emotional disturbances. Because they felt increasingly<br>socially inadequate, they now preferred to isolate themselves.<br>Concentration and ability to comprehend became severely impaired even<br>though IQ tests showed no drop in their intellectual abilities.<br><br>After the study ended, the emotional symptoms continued. In fact,<br>researchers noted that some of the men grew even more negative, depressed,<br>and argumentative, directly after the conclusion of the project!<br><br>What both the U.S. and Canadian studies show is that "emotional" symptoms<br>develop as a direct result of the unavailability of brain and body<br>chemicals. These important chemicals create our stable emotions,<br>behaviors, thoughts, and sanity.<br><br>Of course, back in the mid-twentieth century, scientists were only<br>beginning to discover the many natural vitamins, minerals, amino acids,<br>essential fatty acids, enzymes, endorphins, and neurotransmitters needed<br>for sanity and well-being. Even today, many people do not seem to grasp<br>the concept that our emotional and physical health depends on having the<br>proper concentration of the natural substances the human body needs to<br>sustain life and normal emotional balance.<br><br>In fact, until only the last few decades, li...</p><h2>The Auerbach Will</h2><p>Three generations of betrayal, greed, and love are revealed as Essie Auerbach, matriarch of a wealthy German-Jewish New York family, and her relations--each with plans for controlling the family fortune--learn the contents of the Auerbach will</p><p>No Bio</p><h2>Perfume: The art and craft of fragrance</h2><p>'A woman's perfume tells more about her than her handwriting.'

She became a psychoanalyst four years later, having trained under Melanie Klein, with Paula Heimann and Joan Riviere as her first supervisors. Dr Segal then qualified in child analysis and afterwards became a training analyst in the British Psychoanalytical Society in 1951-52. She also served as President of the British Society and Vice-President of the International Psychoanalytical Association. She was a fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatry, and was also Visiting Professor of the Freud Memorial Chair, University College, London. Her publications include &#39;Klein&#39; (1979), &#39;The Work of Hanna Segal&#39; (1981), &#39;Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein&#39; (1988) and &#39;Dream, Phantasy and Art&#39; (1990).</p><h2>New England Natives: A Celebration of People and Trees</h2><p>Taking us back to the birth of New England&#x2019;s forests, Sheila Connor shows us these trees evolving amidst a succession of human cultures, from the archaic Indians who crafted canoes from white birch and snowshoes from ash, to the colonists who built ships of oak and pine, to the industrialists who laid railroad tracks on chestnut timber, to the tanners who used hemlock bark to treat the leather required to shoe the Union army. In this engaging narrative, cultural history affords insights into forestry, botany, horticulture, and ecology, which in turn illuminate the course of human conduct in a wooded land. Beautifully written and lavishly illustrated, this book will delight readers with a special interest in the trees of the region, as well as those who wonder what our American culture owes to nature.</p><p>The forests of the &#34;New Founde Lande&#34; of New England have sustained human life for thousands of years, and they offered an irresistible lure for the European settlers who shaped the early history of the United States. In this leisurely look at the way people and trees have gotten along over the centuries, Harvard archivist Sheila Connor delves into the arcana of sugar-maple tapping and clockmaking, explores the origins of Arbor Day and witch hazel, and generally has a fine time evoking New England&#39;s past. She also points to a forested future, thanks to widespread conservation and reseeding campaigns over the last century, noting with pleasure that &#34;at no time since the arrival of the Europeans, until today, has so much of New England&#39;s landscape been forested.&#34; Connor&#39;s book brims with affection and intelligence, and tree enthusiasts everywhere ought to have a look at it.Sheila Connor was, until her retirement, Archivist and Librarian at the Arnold Arboretum, Harvard University.</p><h2>Super Dictionary</h2><p>More than 4000 alphabetically-arranged words are defined within story sentences involving Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash, and other super heros.</p><p></p><h2>The Hothouse by the East River</h2><p>In 1973 Paul and Elsa are living in New York.

He is an Emmy Award-winning producer and best-selling author of The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History. He lives in New York City.Fricke nicely balances his tribute to Garland, placing a positive spin on her at times self-destructive behavior yet still accurately portraying her frailties. Garland's daughter Lorna Luft establishes a loving tone with her touching introduction, proclaiming Garland a wonderful parent. Fricke (The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History) chronologically covers the star's radio, film, TV and stage history (from the 1920s through the '60s) via superb, previously unpublished photographs, illuminating vignettes and blurbs from affectionate interviews. There she is at age two, sporting an adorable pixie haircut; another shot shows her performing in one of hundreds of vaudeville shows she appeared in through age 13. Fricke meticulously analyzes The Wizard of Oz and the increasing pressure that resulted in Garland's drug addiction. Brief references to unhappy affairs with Joseph Mankiewicz, Tyrone Power and Artie Shaw are secondary to Fricke's thesis: that Garland was not about tragedy, but about talent and an ability to survive any obstacle. Glamorous b&amp;w images of Garland belting out a tune from Meet Me in St. Louis in 1944 give way to more garish shots of Garland at home with daughter Liza Minnelli in 1960. Fricke glosses over some harsher truths and only shows dark hints of Garland's instability, as in orchestrator Gordon Jenkins's statement, "Judy, like all great stars, is inclined towards moodiness." But he successfully shows readers why the star remains an immortal, cherished icon, and his comprehensive volume belongs on the shelf of everyone who loves Garland and the musical genre. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Porsche: Excellence Was Expected- The Complete History of the Sports and Racing Cars (An Automobile Quarterly Library Series Book)</h2><p>Porsche: Excellence Was Expected is a monumental book which chronicles the daily drama, the trials and errors, the brilliant successes of one of the world&#39;s most revolutionary and sophisticated sports and racing cars.

Michel had been a blindfold scholar until, newly married, he contracted tuberculosis. His will to recover brings self-discovery and the growing desire to rebel against his background of culture, decency and morality. But the freedom from constraints that Michel finds on his restless travels is won at great cost. And freedom itself, he finds, can be a burden. Gide&#39;s novel examines the inevitable conflicts that arise when a pleasure seeker challenges conventional society and, without moralizing, it raises complex issues involving the extent of personal responsibility.</p><p>With today's headlines and talk shows, it takes a lot to shock a reader--certainly more than was required in 1902, when Andr� Gide's <i>The Immoralist</i> was first published. What was seen then as a story of dereliction translates today into a tale of introspection and fierce self-discovery. While traveling to Tunis with his new bride, the Parisian scholar Michel is overcome by tuberculosis. As he slowly convalesces, he revels in the physical pleasures of living and resolves to forgo his studies of the past in order to experience the present--to let "the layers of acquired knowledge peel away from the mind like a cosmetic and reveal, in patches, the naked flesh beneath, the authentic being hidden there."<p> But this is not the Michel his colleagues knew, nor the man Marceline married, and he must hide his new values under the patina of what he now reviles. Bored by Parisian society, he moves to a family farm in Normandy. He is happy there, especially in the company of young Charles, but he must soon return to the city and academe. Michel remains restless until he gives his first lecture and runs into M�nalque, who has long outraged society, and recognizes in him a reflection of his torment. Finally, Michel heads south, deeper into the desert, until, as he confides to his friends, he is lost in the sea of sand, under a clear, directionless sky.</p><p> What Gide's story lacks in sensationalism is fulfilled by his descriptive prose, which evokes the exotic nature of Michel's inner and outer journey: "I did not understand the forbearance of this African earth, submerged for days at a time and now awakening from winter, drunk with water, bursting with new juices; it laughed in this springtime frenzy whose echo, whose image I perceived within myself." --<i>Joannie Kervran Stangeland</i></p>Andre Gide was born in Paul Guillaume in Paris. He was author of over 50 volumes of fiction, poetry, plays, criticism, biography, belles lettres, and translations. Among his best-known works are FRUITS OF THE EARTH and THE COUNTERFEITERS, his translations of OEDIPUS and HAMLET, and his JOURNAL. He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1947. Gide died in 1951.</p><h2>Murders on Elderberry Road: A Queen Bees Quilt Mystery</h2><p>Join Po and her sleuthing quilter friends, the Queen Bees, as they uncover murders in this fourbook mystery series.

It has visited us in our dorm rooms and apartments, sometimes before we&#x2019;d even unpacked or painted. It has nourished us during our jobs, consoled us during break-ups, and celebrated our triumphs right alongside us.<br> <br>In August 2009, Colin Hagendorf set out to review every regular slice of pizza in Manhattan, and his blog, <i>Slice Harvester</i>, was born. Two years and nearly 400 slices later, he&#x2019;d been featured in <i>The</i> <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, the <i>Daily News</i> (New York), and on radio shows all over the country. Suddenly, this self-proclaimed punk who was barely making a living doing burrito delivery and selling handmade zines had a following. But at the same time Colin was stepping up his game for the masses (grabbing slices with Phoebe Cates and her teenage daughter, reviewing kosher pizza so you don&#x2019;t have to), his personal life was falling apart.<br> <br>A problem drinker and chronic bad boyfriend, he started out using the blog as a way to escape&#x2014;the hangovers, the midnight arguments, the hangovers again&#x2014;until finally realizing that by taking steps to reach a goal day by day, he&#x2019;d actually put himself in a place to finally take control of his life for good.</p><p>Colin Atrophy Hagendorf is an adult punk rocker and aspiring long-term sober guy. He loves eating pizza, working to dismantle systematic structures of oppression, and carefree afternoon naps. He collects obscure riot grrrl 7&#34;s and 70s paperback editions of Sam Delany novels. He lives in Queens with three cats.Slice Harvester PROLOGUE<p></p> <br>Less than a dozen blocks from the very tip-top of the island of Manhattan sits Grandpa&#x2019;s Brick Oven Pizza, its oddly tropical facade a bright orange contrast to the drab surrounding buildings. There&#x2019;s a fake wooden awning, the whole place is painted the color of an underripe clementine, and in the summertime the Italian ice cart stationed out front sports one of those grass umbrellas. Imagine if Tom Hanks built a pizzeria on the island he was stuck on in that movie I&#x2019;ve never seen where he talks to a volleyball. That&#x2019;s kind of what Grandpa&#x2019;s looks like.<br> <br>The fact that the very first stop on my pizza-eating odyssey looked more like a tiki hut than a pizzeria was either auspicious or ominous, I couldn&#x2019;t tell which&#x2014;or maybe I was too hungover to care. But either way, I felt a vague sense of anxiety standing outside, knowing that if I stepped through the door and ordered a slice of pizza, I was committing to something big&#x2014;and taking my plans out of the realm of Drinking and Talking and into the realm of Going and Doing.<br> <br>Not that Drinking and Talking is a bad place to be&#x2014;tons of the best unshot films, unpainted murals, unillustrated graphic novels, and unrecorded music live together in the land of Drinking and Talking. They lead happy-go-lucky lives inside their consequence-�free bubble. If you take a look inside, it&#x2019;s like peering through the window of the Barbie Dreamhouse at Barbie and Ken cooking some vegan chili while Skipper and Midge collate zines in the living room: the residents of Drinking and Talking are all perfect, fully realized, flawless. But as soon as you try to coax one of them into the world of Going and Doing, you realize that their legs don&#x2019;t bend the right way and their heads pop off if you&#x2019;re not careful. What I&#x2019;m trying to say is, Drinking and Talking is much safer than Going and Doing.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s what I was thinking about while looking in the window of Grandpa&#x2019;s Pizza. A few weeks ago it seemed so easy. I was drinking wine with a buddy of mine and said I was gonna eat a plain slice from every pizzeria in New York City. I was gonna eat all the pizza. How had no one done that yet? &#x2019;Cause I was gonna do it! I&#x2019;d call myself the Slice Harvester, like some kind of mozzarella-fueled superhero. Best idea I&#x2019;d ever had.<br> <br>A few weeks passed. I continued riding my bike around delivering food, drinking with my friends, going to punk shows. I told everybody about my great idea (I didn&#x2019;t have to take it out of Drinking and Talking to do that, since we were all always drunk). One night while doing speed with my friend Sweet Tooth and listening to the contents of this suitcase full of cassette tapes he&#x2019;d found in the trash, I said, &#x201c;Listen, I&#x2019;ve got it. I&#x2019;ll start at the top of Manhattan and go down, west to east, until I get to the bottom. That&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;m gonna do it. Start at the top, work my way down.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tooth was intently respooling one of the cassette tapes; he didn&#x2019;t even look up, just monotoned, &#x201c;When do we start?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I work all weekend. What are you doing Tuesday?&#x201d;<br> <br>And that&#x2019;s how on Tuesday evening, August 11, 2009, I wound up standing outside Grandpa&#x2019;s Brick Oven Pizza with a composition notebook and a pen I&#x2019;d bought at the dollar store, wondering whether I had the chutzpah to follow through.<br> <br>At least that&#x2019;s what I thought I was feeling, based on the nausea, but it may have just been that I was hungover and hadn&#x2019;t consumed anything all day except bodega coffee and the shittiest cigarettes&#x2014;the best I could afford on my delivery-boy wages (not that I&#x2019;m complaining). I&#x2019;d spent that afternoon guzzling weak coffee at the copy shop, printing up zines for Support New York, the survivor support collective my best friend Milo and I had been part of for almost a decade. The collective was getting ready to host a table at some conference or anarchist book fair, and because I&#x2019;m an eternal procrastinator, I ended up schlepping this granny cart full of zines along on my inaugural pizza mission.<br> <br>Maybe I was nervous and hungover; it doesn&#x2019;t matter. What matters is that eventually I tilted back my cart and pushed it through the door.<br> <br>Grandpa&#x2019;s is just as ultraorange and oddly tropical on the inside as its exterior implies. There were quite a few customers on line ahead of me. I couldn&#x2019;t really make out what any of them were saying over the Trio Reynoso record blaring from behind the counter, but there were two definitely stoned construction workers in front of me who seemed hella stoked for the pizza, and their excitement was infectious. I took it as a good sign, too, because in my experience, carpenters and electricians work all over the city and tend to know where the good food is.<br> <br>When it was my turn I intoned, &#x201c;Gimme a regular slice&#x201d; (because that&#x2019;s how you say it in New York&#x2014;none of this fakakta &#x201c;Pardon me, sir, I&#x2019;d like one piece of cheese pizza, please,&#x201d; okay?), and headed to my table, which was also orange and was decorated with what looked like crayon drawings of lighthouses and other Beach Shit that in no way made Grandpa&#x2019;s resemble a tropical paradise.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d like to say I savored that first slice, but the truth is I slammed it in, like, one minute flat. See, the slice at Grandpa&#x2019;s is too thin to support its own weight, and not good enough to be worth how little food you get for your money ($2.50 in 2009, $2.75 in 2014). I crammed probably half the slice in my mouth on my first bite. Admittedly, I&#x2019;m really good at cramming things into my mouth, but even an amateur could&#x2019;ve wrecked this flimsy pizza.<br> <br>Still, even in my hungover haze, I knew there was more to Grandpa&#x2019;s slice than its lack of structural integrity. Despite being too small, the flavors were all totally right on&#x2014;the cheese tasted like cheese, not like chemicals; the sauce was slightly sweet and slightly tangy; the dough was salty enough&#x2014;but the ratios were off. There was a decent amount of sauce and cheese, but there wasn&#x2019;t enough dough to support it. Pizza is a food that you&#x2019;re supposed to be able to eat while you walk, and this slice would&#x2019;ve been far too sloppy for that. What&#x2019;s a guy in a rush supposed to do? If I had tried to eat this on the go, I would&#x2019;ve splattered tomato sauce all over my Crass tank top. Good ingredients, good flavor, bad ratios, too much money. This was basically right in the middle of good and bad. Completely neutral.<br> <br>I jotted all these thoughts down in my new notebook, along with the name and address of the pizza place. Maybe it&#x2019;s hindsight, but I feel like a slice with some ideal qualities and some obvious flaws was the perfect way to start my career as a pizza reviewer. It would now be up to me to travel across the island of Manhattan to sift through all the complexities of the various combinations of cheese and sauce and the nuances of crust, flavor, bite, ratios, and aftertaste in search of the perfect slice, and to warn my fellow citizens against inferior pizza. I grabbed my cart and headed out the door.<br> <br>The Slice Harvester was born.</p><h2>Frogs (Nic Bishop: Scholastic Reader, Level 2)</h2><p>Join photographer and biologist Nic Bishop as he takes a closer look at frogs.<br>Now even the youngest readers can join Sibert Medal-winning photographer and biologist Nic Bishop as he takes a closer look at the world's most amazing animals.

What does it have to do with salvation from sin and God&#x2019;s reconciliation with the world?For centuries, many metaphors have attempted to explain this astounding work of God, but none has risen above the others. The atonement, like salvation, encompasses far more than any one image can contain.In Atonement and Salvation, Eric Vail explores the vastness of God&#x2019;s saving work in Christ and the reconciling effects of the atonement on creation and humanity. Rather than examine all the images used throughout church history, the author narrows his attention to those in the Bible. He expertly brings to light the grand picture of God&#x2019;s atoning activity, emphasizing that at its heart is God&#x2019;s extravagant love.Written with clarity and precision, this book is an appealing addition to any Christian&#x2019;s library.

Yet many Americans continue to regard the United States as a Christian society. How are we adapting to the new diversity? Do we casually announce that we "respect" the faiths of non-Christians without understanding much about those faiths? Are we willing to do the hard work required to achieve genuine religious pluralism?</p><br><p> Award-winning author Robert Wuthnow tackles these and other difficult questions surrounding religious diversity and does so with his characteristic rigor and style. <i>America and the Challenges of Religious Diversity</i> looks not only at how we have adapted to diversity in the past, but at the ways rank-and-file Americans, clergy, and other community leaders are responding today. Drawing from a new national survey and hundreds of in-depth qualitative interviews, this book is the first systematic effort to assess how well the nation is meeting the current challenges of religious and cultural diversity.</p><br><p> The results, Wuthnow argues, are both encouraging and sobering--encouraging because most Americans do recognize the right of diverse groups to worship freely, but sobering because few Americans have bothered to learn much about religions other than their own or to engage in constructive interreligious dialogue. Wuthnow contends that responses to religious diversity are fundamentally deeper than polite discussions about civil liberties and tolerance would suggest. Rather, he writes, religious diversity strikes us at the very core of our personal and national theologies. Only by understanding this important dimension of our culture will we be able to move toward a more reflective approach to religious pluralism.</p></p><p><br><p>"This book is one of Wuthnow's best. He lends his fine-grained analysis to a topic that is at the heart of the experiment called American democracy: how people manage the idea that religion should be about the one true faith with their desire to welcome faiths other than their own."<b>--Alan Wolfe, Boston College</b><br></p><br><p>"This is a wonderful book. I know of no other works that interrogate the contradictions between the historical sense many Americans hold that America is a "Christian nation" and the current realities and challenges of religious diversity and pluralism. It is a very thorough, penetrating examination of a topic that requires immediate attention."<b>--Lynn Davidman, Brown University</b><br></p><br><b>Robert Wuthnow</b> is the Gerhard R.

He has won the Kate Greenaway Medal twice and has been the UK nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Award twice. His books are published all over the world.</p><p>"Based on the true story of an extraordinary dog's exploits in World War I, this fictionalized account is told by Stubby's human friend, Robert Conroy. The soldier recalls how he adopted the stray dog who wandered in to training camp and smuggled him on board a troop ship to France. In the trenches, Stubby put his excellent hearing and sense of smell to work to guard the troops, warn soldiers of impending gas attacks, and even catch a German spy. When Stubby was wounded by shrapnel, Conroy carried him from the battlefield so medics could tend to him. Not only did Conroy and Stubby survive but the dog was also hailed as a hero, leading a victory parade after their return to the United States. A photo of Stubby in his army jacket, which was sewn by French women and decorated with medals and badges, accompanies Foreman's historical note at the end. The illustrations depict wounded soldiers, bursting shells, and bleak trenches and landscapes, which may upset some young readers. Yet the violence is not overwhelming. In images of battles or peace time, Stubby is the focus, his friendly, alert face drawing readers into the narrative. Conroy's admiration for Stubby's loyalty, intelligence, and courage shines through this account of a unique friendship. Ann Bausum's <em>Stubby the War Dog</em>, a straightforward history for older readers, features numerous photographs for those wanting to learn more. Stubby has been the subject of other books, plus an animated movie released in 2018. VERDICT Although the centennial observances of World War I are complete, <strong>this compelling story of a brave dog and his soldier companion is a timeless tale of friendship</strong> worth considering for most collections."&#x2015;starred, <em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"In this affecting, poignant picture book, based on actual events during WWI, a soldier relates how a stray dog that found its way into boot camp became a beloved companion. Nicknamed Stubby (for his 'flat face and short legs'), the dog remains by the soldier's side throughout training, traveling overseas (Stubby snuck aboard), and enduring the trenches in France, where Stubby's keen senses also help detect approaching enemies or poison gas. But then soldier and Stubby are caught in an explosion. While Stubby is treated, they're separated, but eventually they're reunited and spend the rest of the war and years after together. Expressive, detailed color-washed illustrations depict lighthearted scenes (Stubby saluting an officer with his paw) as well as dramatic ones, such as soldiers and Stubby in gas masks. This offers <strong>an accessible, engaging approach to a high-interest topic</strong>, using descriptive first-person prose and lively, eloquent touches that effectively convey Stubby's and the soldiers' experiences, their enduring bond, and why Stubby became a well-known inspiration to many. An afterword fills in more background on the hero dog."&#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"This true story of a stray dog that became a decorated war hero was first published in England to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I. The smell of cooking attracts many stray dogs to the soldiers' training camp, but one particular dog finds one particular soldier, and the two become inseparable. 'An odd little dog with a flat face and short legs,' he is dubbed Stubby. Endearingly portrayed with big eyes and a let's-play expression, Stubby goes off to Europe with his new soldier friend, the unnamed narrator of the story. Stubby marches, holes up in trenches, becomes a guard dog, wears a gas mask, and is injured on the battlefield. Stubby goes home a hero and leads the great victory parade, wagging his hero's tail in this hero's tale. Though he has created a darling of a canine protagonist, Foreman doesn't shy away from the realities of war, vividly depicting villages in ruins, bullets 'zipping and whistling around,' injured soldiers, and Stubby himself 'covered in mud and blood, his eyes full of pain.' Except for an occasional face in a cheering crowd, all characters are white. While Foreman makes the tale universal, the backmatter fills in specific details: The soldier's name was Robert Conroy, the training camp was in Connecticut, and the fighting was in France. <strong>A heartwarming tale indeed.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>I love Russian: A1 coursebook (beginner) (Russian Edition)</h2><p><p>'I Love&nbsp;Russian&nbsp;A1" is a bright and up-to-date course book, intended for levels from complete beginners to A1+ according to CEFR (120-140 contact hours).

Her early images?a conversation between Senator Joseph McCarthy and Roy Cohn, Eisenhower being surprised by the press right after receiving the presidential nomination?exhibit a sense of timing, curiosity, and technical skill that have produced long-lived, often prophetic images. By mid-career she had mastered a rapport with her subjects that allowed her unique access to the off-camera faces of such famous actresses as Joan Crawford and Marilyn Monroe, a "Hollywood legend who runs like a thread" through Arnold's work of the 1950s.

But what was it like to actually live in those extraordinary times? Now you can find out. These 36 lectures provide a different perspective on the society and culture of the Middle Ages - one that entrenches you in the daily human experience of living during this underappreciated era. Drawing on history, literature, the arts, technology, and science, these lectures will deepen the way you understand not only the Middle Ages but everything that came afterward: From the Renaissance, to the Enlightenment, to your own world. Filled with amazing insights, this series brings you closer than ever before to life as it was lived and felt. You&#39;ll meet the likes of William Caxton, England&#39;s first printer who not only printed and distributed a variety of works but also often had to translate them himself; learn about Hugh of Payns and the role of his Knights Templar - organized for the protection of pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem - in the creation of the first modern bank; see how communities dealt with marriage in a time when the church had not yet drawn this institution into its orbit; and much more. Rich with information and period detail (including revealing examples of medieval literature from the English, French, Norse, Icelandic, and Italian worlds), these lectures will dramatically increase your understanding of how lives in the Middle Ages were really lived.</p><p></p><h2>All About Alfie</h2><p>A collection of four short stories previously published individually and including: &#34;Alfie Gets in First,&#34; &#34;Alfie&#39;s Feet,&#34; &#34;Alfie Gives a Hand,&#34; and &#34;An Evening at Alfie&#39;s.&#34;</p><p>Shirley Hughes was trained at Liverpool Art School and at the Ruskin School of Art, Oxford. She illustrated many books by other authors before she started to write her own picture books. Her own family, two sons and a daughter, were very young then and she learned the craft of storytelling mostly by reading to them. Her books have won many awards and are published in Europe, China, Japan, and the Far East, as well as Australia, Canada, the U. K., and the U. S. A. She travels widely, talking to and drawing for children in schools and libraries as well as at adult conventions. <p>Shirley is married to an architect, now retired, and they have lived in the same family house, overlooking a London square garden, for more than forty years. They have, to date, six grandchildren who keep them on their toes.</p> In Her Own Words...<p>"I grew up in a nice, quiet, well-behaved suburb of Liverpool. But our uneventful lives were rudely interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. Wewent to school carrrying gas masks, did air-raid shelter drills, saved Up mountains of scrap metal, and attempted to knit Mufflers for the troops. (Mine were very long; I never quite got the hang of casting off.) I slept under the stairs (hiring the winter of the big blitz, when we saw the sky over Liverpool lit by searchlights, tracer bullets, and Fires from the burning docks.</p><p>"All this may sound very exciting, But the problem with wartime is that when it's not frightening, it's deadly dull. You can't go on holiday, the grown-ups are too harassed and exhausted to pay much attention to amusements, and every nice kind of food is scarce. I recall, on a rare trip to the seaside (the beach was out of bounds, full of barbed wire and concrete gun emplacements), gazing at a longempty slot machine which had held chocolate bars and now seemed like a rusting icon from another world.</p><p>"Nevertheless, we managed to have a good time. We drew a lot, read and wrote stories, and got up magazines. (Mine was called, rather unoriginally, 'Girl's Own.) We acted plays, dressed in homemade costumes, to any audience we could press into service, cats included. Later, we became hopelessly stageand movie-struck. I think that by accident I had an ideal childhood for an illustrator. In a pre-televisual age, our Sunday afternoon outings, if we were lucky, were to Liverpool Art Gallery, which was cram-full of Victorian an narrative paintings with titles like 'The Hopeless Dawn,' 'Too Late!,' and 'When Did You Last See Your Father?' Tremendous stuff, and it fueled my lifelong conviction that stories and pictures belong together. I think most children probably feel the same.</p><p>"With me, drawing and painting stuck. I was never much good at anything else, so I went on doing them. Writing was a secret thing, kept well under wraps. When I emerged from art school, I wrote to a distinguished typographer saying I wanted to illustrate children's books. He wrote back saying that this was impossible 'except as an adjunct to teaching or matrimony.' All the same, I was determined to do it.</p><p>"When I think of an idea for a story, it always starts with a very strong image in my head, usually of a child doing something. With picture books, the words are unthinkable without the images-the two develop together, like a film. Alfie first made his appearance running up the street ahead of his mum, who came trundling behind with the shopping and his baby sister, Annie Rose, in the buggy. I knew from the first moment I reached for a pencil to get down a rough drawing of him that he was positively pink in the face with determination to get into the action. A lot has happened to him-and to mesince. He is a very ordinary little boy, a kind of fouryear-old Everyman just beginning to come to grips with the complexities of life. Now, rather to my amazement, well over two million Alfie books have been sold worldwide. But I still relate back to that rapid sketch done in a state of high excitement, which is where it all began."</p>"No one can match Shirley Hughes in the simple mastery of both worlds and pictures."<br><i>&#x2014;Times Educational Supplement</i></p><h2>The Complete Manual of Sexual Positions: A Sensual Guide to Lovemaking</h2><p>&#39;The Complete Manual of Sexual Positions&#39; is a wonderfully informative and erotic book for lovers who are seeking more satisfying romance and greater sexual pleasure.

Sourcebooks republished the book under its original title, Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife in 2004.

Ms. Berdoll has also authored Fandango, a historical romance set during San Francisco's Gold Rush.

She is happily married to her high-school sweetheart and lives outside Austin, Texas.Review for The Ruling Passion From Austenprose.com Best-selling author Linda Berdoll s Mr. Darcy Takes A Wife and Darcy &amp; Elizabeth have been hailed as sexy, hilarious, poignant and wild, bawdy and utterly enjoyable (Booklist.) The Ruling Passion, her highly anticipated sequel to the sequels, has finally come to fruition... If your sensibilities are offended by explicit, passionate love scenes with Jane Austen s original namesakes, this is presumably NOT the book for you. However, those who delight in reading about the Darcys beyond Pride and Prejudice, including all their complexities, and intimacies, (in and around the bedroom), and most particularly if you are a fan of Berdoll s previous works, The Ruling Passion is not to be missed! Yes, hold on to your bonnets as Linda Berdoll has quite done it again.

While cats were deified by the ancient Egyptians, they were vilified by the medieval Church, before the Renaissance and Baroque periods saw their gradual rehabilitation. By the eighteenth century cats had become popular household pets worldwide. Generations of artists have treasured their contrariness and beauty, and while the cat does not always occupy centre stage in paintings, it always adds an extra symbolic dimension to a picture, or illuminates its meaning in an unexpected way. This sumptuously illustrated book examines the relationship between cats and humans from ancient times to the present, offering fascinating insights into the prominence of the cat in art in cultures worldwide. Thematic chapters explore in detail a rich and rewarding collection of paintings, prints, drawings and sculptures, creating a book that will have enduring appeal among art lovers and cat lovers alike.</p><p>Caroline Bugler Editor of Art Quarterly, the magazine of the Art Fund, the fundraising charity for works of art.

Criteria for selection are that the item or concept must have originated in the Americas, it must have been used by the indigenous people, and it must have been adopted in some way by other cultures. Some of the innovations may have been independently developed in other parts of the world (geometry, for example, was developed in ancient China, Greece, and the Middle East as well as in the Americas) but still fit all three criteria. The period of time covered is 25,000 B.C. to the twentieth century. Among the entries are <i>Adobe, Agriculture, Appaloosa horse breed</i>, <i>Chocolate,</i> <i>Cigars, Diabetes medication, Freeze-drying, Hydraulics, Trousers, Urban planning,</i> and <i>Zoned biodiversity.</i> Readers will find much of the content revealing. The authors note that the Moche "invented the electrochemical production of electricity" although they used it only for electroplating, a process they developed "more than a thousand years" before the Europeans, who generally get the credit. The Aztec medical system was far more comprehensive than anything available in Europe at the time of contact.<p>The entries are in alphabetical order. Most are anywhere from one paragraph to a column in length, though some <i>(Stonemasonry techniques</i>, <i>Pharmacology, Road systems</i> ) cover a page or more. Each entry includes the date and area of origination and has a short bibliography of secondary resources at the end. The cross-references appear in capital letters within an entry or as <i>see also</i> references at the end. The introduction has cross-references in it as well. Some of the entries include black-and-white illustrations or photographs. The only critical item missing from most entries is a pronunciation guide.</p><p>The end matter includes two appendixes: "Tribes Organized by Culture Area" and a selection of maps. These are followed by a glossary (of mostly medical terms used in many entries but again with no pronunciation guides), a chronology, and a bibliography (with a few Internet sites). There are several indexes: "Entries by Tribe, Group, or Linguistic Group"; "Entries by Geographical Culture Area"; a subject index; and a general index.</p><p>This is a well-written book with fascinating information and wonderful pictures.

David M. Levy here demonstrates that these assertions are simply false: political economy became "dismal" because Carlyle, Ruskin, and Dickens were horrified at the idea that systems of slavery were being replaced by systems in which individuals were allowed to choose their own paths in life. At a minimum, they argued, "we" white people ought to be directing the lives of "them," people of color. <br>Economists of the time argued, on the other hand, that people of color were to be protected by the rule of law--hence the moniker "the dismal science." <br>A startling image from 1893, which is reproduced in full color on this book's jacket, shows Ruskin killing someone who appears to be nonwhite. A close look reveals that the victim is reading "The Dismal Science." <br>Levy discusses this image at length and also includes in his text weblinks to Carlyle's "Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question" and to Mill's response, demonstrating that these are central documents in British classical economics. He explains Adam Smith's egalitarian foundations, contrasting Smith's approach to the hierarchical alternative proposed by Carlyle. Levy also examines various visual representations of this debate and provides an illuminating discussion of Smith's "katallactics," the science of exchange, comparing it with the foundations of modern neoclassical economics. <br><i>How the Dismal Science Got Its Name</i> also introduces the notion of "rational choice scholarship" to explain how attacks on market economics from a context in which racial slavery was idealized have been interpreted as attacks on market economics from a humanistic or egalitarian context. Thus it will greatly appeal to economists, political scientists, philosophers, students of Victorian literature, and historians. <br>David M. Levy is Associate Professor of Economics and Research Associate, Center for Study of Public Choice, George Mason University. <br></p><p>&#34;Levy&#39;s brave book, intriguing throughout, exhibits the disreputable, even racist, history of the case against capitalism.

CFA Berlin</h2><p><b>Scrupulous and precise: the drawings of Walter Pichler</b><p>�If you make a drawing and it is entirely without purpose, then you take a step back, and at the same time you become ever more precise. If you are too bold, you isolate the object you want to report on; if you are too timid, you do not capture the object it was your intention to report on.� Scrupulous, precise, yet at the same time retaining great artistic freedom for himself&#x2014;this was how Walter Pichler (1936-2012) came across to people and likewise pointed the way to understanding his work. On the one hand there is the drawing, the basis of Pichler&#x2019;s work, yet above all there is the space and the nature of sculpture, the most important parameters of Pichler&#x2019;s work. These are given form in works on a variety of themes: the person in the space, sculpture, the depiction of sculpture, Pichler himself, woman, man, the head, the torso, the friend, the mother, the couple, the family, the child, the bed, an occurrence, death, the wounded, the wanderer, the drinker, the sketcher, the watchwoman, the insulted, the person standing around, a construction, a floor plan, the house, the room, the cross, an important detail, a conversational situation. So it&#x2019;s also about the human body and its sensibilities brought about by specific circumstances, and these become materially and spiritually tangible as states of consciousness, writes Christian Reder, companion of Pichler and one of the two authors of this publication. Early on, in his early thirties, Walter Pichler was recognised internationally as an independent and explicitly experimental artist, who would not allow himself to be limited to any one area, and in the years that followed he had a number of much-noticed exhibitions and participations: at the Museum of Modern Art (1967 and 1975), at Documenta 4 (1968), at the Venice Biennale (1982, most recently in 2013 in the Palazzo Enciclopedico), at the St�del Museum in Frankfurt/Main (1987), the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (1998) and MAK in Vienna (1990 and 2011). Through these, Walter Pichler showed himself to be �one of those artists whose work becomes ever more puzzling over time�, states Stephanie Weber, the second author of this book, which may also have to do with the fact that he was, as he himself said, �anti-ideas�, and therefore vehemently opposed to a joining of the artistic process with a purpose or an ideology.</p><p>Exhibition:<br> CFA Contemporary Fine Arts, Berlin, 14/9&#x2013;2/11/2013</p></p><p><p>Scrupulous, precise, yet at the same time retaining great artistic freedom for himself&#x2014;this was how <b>Walter Pichler</b> (1936-2012) came across to people and likewise pointed the way to understanding his work.

These are given form in works on a variety of themes: the person in the space, sculpture, the depiction of sculpture, Pichler himself, woman, man, the head, the torso, the friend, the mother, the couple, the family, the child, the bed, an occurrence, death, the wounded, the wanderer, the drinker, the sketcher, the watchwoman, the insulted, the person standing around, a construction, a floor plan, the house, the room, the cross, an important detail, a conversational situation. Walter Pichler had a number of much-noticed exhibitions and participations: at the Museum of Modern Art (1967 and 1975), at Documenta 4 (1968), at the Venice Biennale (1982, most recently in 2013 in the Palazzo Enciclopedico), at the St�del Museum in Frankfurt/Main (1987), the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (1998) and MAK in Vienna (1990 and 2011). </p></p><h2>Bootmaker And The Elves</h2><p>A retelling, set in the Old West, of the traditional story about two elves who help a poor shoemaker, or in this case a bootmaker, and his wife</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 2. "The Shoemaker and the Elves," retold in the colorful language of the Old West. A poor bootmaker is down on his luck and down to his last scraps of leather. After a night of worrying, he is "hornswoggled" to find a finished pair of fancy boots on his workbench. A rich rancher comes along and pays for them with a wad of money "big enough to choke a cow," allowing the bootmaker to buy more leather. Each day, more magical boots appear, and more "rootin' tootin'" cowboys and rodeo queens show up to get shod. Finally, the man and his wife stay up late enough to spy on their midnight helpers. They then hatch the expected plan to reward the elves with tiny blue jeans, Western shirts, cowboy hats, and, of course, itty-bitty boots. The delighted elves scoot away into the sunrise, but by now the bootmaker has plenty of ideas for deluxe footwear and can manage without the little people. Lowell's language is filled with whoopee-ki-yi-yays and the like: "skinny as a snake on stilts"; happy as a "dog with two tails." The similes and metaphors never let up, and Curry's pictures extend the jolly mood. Though dark in hue, they have a much lighter tone than his work for Jim Latimer's Snail and Buffalo (Orchard, 1995).?Ruth Semrau, formerly at Lovejoy School, Allen, TX<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.A bootmaker ``so poor even his shadow had holes in it'' wakes one morning to find his last piece of leather made into a pair of eye-popping, shiny new cowboy boots, bright with stars and roses. Sound familiar? Yep, it's a pair of tiny elves, and when the grateful bootmaker and his wife give them new duds to replace their patched overalls, they dance out the door, singing, ``Whoopee-ki-yi-yay, it's time to play! Yo-e-lay-eee-ooo, happy trails to you!'' As she did for Little Red Cowboy Hat (p. 302), Lowell gives the folktale a true Western spin, much abetted by the inventive Curry: Together they describe and depict each unique set of footwear in lovingly explicit detail. Like the elves, this retelling will leave readers ``just as pleased as a dog with two tails.'' (Picture book/folklore. 7-9) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Beginning with his strong-willed family"The ill luck principle applied here with a vengeance"he recalls his roots, his origins among a people who knew hardship. His entrance into the Jesuit community was both a withdrawal from that life and a wondrous opening to another. In the long period of preparation for priesthood, Berrigan blossomed as teacher, poet, charismatic leader of college students, notably on the Cornell campus. Paying tribute to Dorothy Day and to her style of Christian community that influenced him, he describes his soul as "moving in a contrary wind." His acts of civil disobedience with his brother Philip, also a priest, their arrests and convictions, are well known. Today, Berrigan, a member of the Jesuit community in New York City, remains actively engaged in social causes. In this assessment of his life, the 66-year-old author shows that his fidelity to the precepts of Ignatius Loyola endures. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.With humility, deep insight, and poetic sensitivity of perception and expression, Berrigan gives the story of his life. He describes his early years as the fifth of six sons, his entrance into the Jesuits, his growing social activism while a chaplain at Cornell, his sacrifice of security and freedom to protest the Vietnam War in an act of civil disobedience, his further civil disobedience as a fugitive, and finally his increasing sensitivity to gay liberation and to AIDS. The biography illustrates the development of personal conscience and integrity, and especially the roles his mother and younger brother played in that development. Highly recommended.Carolyn M.

He was the author of three novels and the award-winning <i>The Nightmare of Reason: A Life of Franz Kafka</i>.The Nightmare of Reason<br><i>One</i>IN Prague, he is always present but never mentioned, and it comes as a shock suddenly to find oneself face to face with him in the heart of the city--Kafka's brooding features, life-size, cast in black bronze and mounted above eye level on the wall of a drab building on Maisel Street. On this spot, so a small plaque proclaims, stood the house in which the writer Franz Kafka was born.It is a modest memorial, conceived in ambivalence and therefore singularly fitting in its way. Commissioned by Communist authorities, designed by the sculptor Karel Hadlik, and unveiled in 1965, at a time when the human face of socialism began to rise above the parapets of Stalinoid concrete, it was intended as the initial stage in Kafka's metamorphosis from decadent nihilist into a revolutionary critic of capitalist alienation. In the summer of 1968, Soviet tanks put an end to liberal illusions, and further efforts at rehabilitating Kafka were suspended. But his presence, once acknowledged, is hard to exorcise in a town where every moment of the day and night recalls his nightmares. The bronze sculpture was left in place, so was the marker on his house in the Alchemists' Lane--concessions to tourism, or one of those Schweikian triumphs of cunning that have kept the Czech cause alive through the ages. Either way, they bear witness to one all-important, fundamental fact of Kafka's existence: that he was born in Prague, was buried in Prague, and spent almost all forty-one years of his life in this citadel of lost causes, the "little mother with claws" that never loosened her grip on him and shaped his vision of the world.An uncanny world in which to grow up, still solidly embedded in the Middle Ages, walled in by mystery and legend turned to stone. The view from the Kafka windows stretched back over the centuries, and every walk, every errand took the child through the vaulted archways and twisting alleys of a vengeful past. This was to be his life's stage.Friedrich Thieberger, a renowned Jewish scholar with whom Kafka later studied Hebrew, recounts that "once, as Franz and I were standing at the window looking down on Old Town Square, he pointed at the buildings and said: 'This was my high school, the university was over there, in the building facing us, my office a bit further to the left. This narrow circle ...' and his finger described a few small circles, 'this narrow circle encompasses my entire life.'"But long before the town became a concept in the child's mind, long before the physical reality of even his most immediate environment began to register in meaningful and coherent images, he had to find his way in the far more bewildering shadow world of very large, powerful human beings and learn to deal with the dual threat of both their presence and their absence. What Kafka chose to remember about his childhood is highly revealing, though no more so than what he chose to forget. Even a "memory come alive," as he once described himself in one of his last diary entries, tends to be selective in ways determined by beginnings beyond memory--by a real-life mother who unwittingly betrayed him long before her image fused with the symbol of his quest for love, just as the real-life father, with his waxed mustache and drill-sergeant temper, preceded the image of divine omnipotence.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Posterity has come to know them only as "Kafka's parents"--such are the perils of raising a writer in the family, especially a writer devoid of conscious hypocrisy. Yet Herrmann Kafka was already thirty-one years old when he became Kafka's father, a demanding role at best, for which he happened to be particularly ill equipped. The very qualities that had enabled him to claw his way out of grinding poverty into middle-class respectability and relative affluence--unself-conscious egotism, brute drive, and a single-minded concentration on money and status--did not make for grace, warmth, and sensitivity in his contacts with people in general. As a parent, however, he suffered from an additional handicap: he himself had never had a childhood.His own father, Jakob Kafka, born in 1814, was the second of nine children--six boys and three girls--raised in a one-room shack in the Czech village of Wossek. Under the laws then in force, he was not permitted to marry; a 1789 decree promulgated to curb the growth of the Jewish population barred any but the oldest son of Jewish parents fromobtaining a marriage license, and Jakob had a stepbrother older by a year. What saved him from dying without legitimate progeny--death twice over, in the context of his faith--was the revolution of 1848, or rather its savage repression. By the sort of ironic paradox that crops up with predictable unpredictability throughout Jewish history, the new constitution, designed to strengthen the hand of the autocratic government, brought Jews the very freedoms which the French Revolution and its aftershocks had promised but largely failed to deliver.In granting full citizenship rights to the roughly 400,000 Jews within the empire--including the right to marry at will, to settle in the cities, and to enter trades and professions--the Habsburg bureaucracy was moved not by humanitarian impulses but by political and economic considerations. The business skills and energy of peddlers, moneylenders, and craftsmen were an untapped resource invaluable to a country on the verge of industrialization, and the Jews' peculiar, cohesive, but supranational allegiance made them a potential counterforce to the radicalism of contending nationalities that threatened the survival of the multinational state. But all that mattered to Kafka's grandfather Jakob, in 1848, was that at last he could marry, and he proceeded to do so at once, taking as his wife the daughter of his next-door neighbor.A kosher butcher by trade, Jakob Kafka was a surly giant of a man, reputedly able to lift a bag of potatoes with his teeth, but all his backbreaking labor never netted him more than the barest subsistence. His wife, Franziska Platowski, already thirty-three when she married, had an outgoing and cheerful disposition that, under the circumstances, should have qualified her for sainthood. Between 1850 and 1859, she gave birth to six children and raised them all in that one-room shack, in abject poverty; for long stretches, the family's diet consisted of little more than potatoes.Somehow they survived--the parents as well as all six of their children--itself a rare feat in its day, and evidence of robust genetic equipment. (The shack itself, though, still inhabited after the Second World War, outlasted them all.) The children were put to work as soon as they were strong enough to pull a cart. Summer and winter, in any kind of weather, they had to make the rounds delivering slabs of meat to Jakob's far-flung clientele. The frostbites and footsores that Herrmann, the second-oldest, suffered as a result became his battle scars; he kept regurgitating the inventory of his childhood privations with a mixture of pride and self-pity which his own son in turn found singularlyrevolting. In fact, the perennial paternal litany, half boast and half accusation, of "You don't know how well off you are ... When I was your age ..." loomed large on the list of grievances Kafka hoarded against his father.This sniping across the generation gap is common enough. But in contrast to so many fathers licking their imaginary wounds, Herrmann did not have to invent or exaggerate the hardships of his youth in order to score points, and no one saw this more clearly than the target of his scorn. In "Josephine, the Singer," Kafka's last story, written on his deathbed, he evokes the world in which his father came of age:Our life [he wrote, referring to Josephine's "nation of mice"] simply happens to be such that a child, as soon as it can get about a little and is to some extent able to find its way in the world, must take care of itself just like an adult. We are, for economic reasons, scattered over too large an area, our enemies are too numerous, the dangers that everywhere lie in wait for us are too unpredictable--we simply cannot afford to shield our children from the struggle for existence; to do so would doom them to an early grave. But one additional reason should be cited, this one hopeful rather than depressing: the fertility of our tribe. One generation--and each is immensely populous--crowds the other; the children have no time to be children ... no sooner has a child made its appearance than it is a child no more; other children's faces press in from behind ... rosy with happiness. Yet however charming this may be, and however much others may rightly envy us for it, the fact remains that we cannot give our children a true childhood.The ancestors of both Jakob and Franziska had for at least a century lived in Jewish enclaves surrounded by a Czech peasant population. Unlike most of their coreligionists, forced by a 1787 decree to adopt German surnames, they had--presumably by special dispensation--chosen Slavic names; the Kafkas, at any rate, always assumed that their family name derived from <i>kavka,</i> the Czech word for "jackdaw," although <i>Jakovke</i>, a Yiddish diminutive for Jakob, is another and not unlikely derivation.The Kafkas spoke Czech at home but, like all Jews, sent their children to the Jewish school--schools were denominational, a six-year attendance compulsory for boys--where, by law, German was the language of instruction. Herrmann did his compulsory stint, the full extentof his formal education, and became fluent in spoken German, though he never quite mastered the intricacies of the written language and, to the end of his life, evidently felt more at home in Czech.At fourteen, one year into manhood under Jewish law, he left home for good to make his way in the world. Despite stiff competition, the young peddler survived on his own. Retail distribution in rural areas was still in its infancy, while the increasing volume and variety of manufactured goods--especially in Bohemia, cradle of the nascent industry --required domestic outlets. The Jewish peddlers thus filled a growing need, and many of them laid the foundations for what in later years became respectable fortunes. Some switched to manufacturing; Franz Werfel's father came to own the largest glove factory in Bohemia, Freud's father had a textile plant in Moravia. Others progressed from moneylending to high finance or, like Herrmann Kafka, expanded into the retail and wholesale business.Altogether, the economic position of Austro-Hungarian Jewry in the second half of the nineteenth century improved rapidly. The manifest success of the "founding fathers," however, ought not to obscure the merciless struggle it took to rise from well below bare subsistence to even the relatively modest heights eventually scaled by a Herrmann Kafka. The attitudes and opinions shaped by this experience came to dominate Jewish middle-class life to the end. But even more significant was the preponderance of certain personality traits favoring survival in the ruthlessly competitive world of emerging capitalism, a natural selection that made for a remarkable degree of uniformity in the pattern of their family relations.No one defined and explored that pattern more creatively than Sigmund Freud, himself a child of that same time and place--born at Pribor, Moravia, the son of a textile merchant who went bankrupt as a result of the Czech anti-German and anti-Jewish boycott and moved his family to Vienna in 1859, when Freud was three years old. The world that shaped Freud's vision, the rising Jewish middle class in nineteenth-century Austria, was also the world of the Kafkas, and the almost paradigmatic nature of the oedipal conflict in that family, the often startling literalness with which Kafka himself seemed to be acting out the Freudian script, no doubt owes much to these common antecedents.Psychoanalysis, not least for that very reason, has contributed highly pertinent insights to an understanding of Kafka's character and work.But our ultimate concern is not so much with the ways in which he typified all sons locked in mortal combat with their fathers as with the ways in which he was different and unique: how he came to be Franz Kafka.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>For six years, young Herrmann traveled the byways of rural Bohemia and Moravia. In 1872, at the age of twenty, he was drafted into the Austrian army, served the prescribed two years, during which he was promoted to sergeant, and after his discharge headed for Prague to seek his fortune.The removal of residence restrictions in 1848 had triggered a mass migration of Jews from country to city. To a landless population, subsisting on the margins of an impoverished agricultural economy, the city was the new Jerusalem, the promise of the good life. To the Jews, moreover, increasingly victimized by anti-Semitism, the city also offered such safety as lies in numbers and in anonymity. Within mere decades, the rural ghettoes were deserted, and villages such as Wossek had to close their synagogues for lack of a minyan.Herrmann settled in the decaying slums of the Josephstadt, Prague's teeming medieval ghetto, with its string of bordellos and sleazy dives. It was not the most propitious of times for a young man without funds or connections. The Vienna stock-market crash of 1873 closed out two decades of unprecedented boom and signaled the onset of what turned out to be a tenacious and long-lasting depression. But the twenty-two-year-old army veteran, accustomed to hardship and frugal in his habits, was determined to find ways of starting a business of his own. It took him eight years. He got his chance in 1883, when he married the daughter of a wealthy brewery owner.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>His bride, Julie L�wy, was born on March 23, 1856, in Podebrady, a predominantly Czech town on the river Elbe. Her ancestry included an unusual array of remarkable or at least unconventional characters, deeply religious for the most part and far more concerned with metaphysical pursuits and spiritual values than with the accumulation of worldly goods--Talmudists, miracle rabbis, eccentric troublemakers,Christian converts, and visionaries. In a brief autobiographical sketch written in 1911, Kakfa alluded to this exotic heritage:My Hebrew name is Amschel, after my mother's maternal grandfather, whom my mother--she was six at the time of his death--remembers as a very pious and learned man with a long white beard. She remembers how she had to hold on to the toes of the corpse while asking his forgiveness for whatever wrongs she may have done him. She remembers her grandfather's many books lining the walls. He bathed in the river every day, even in winter, when he had to chop a hole in the ice. My mother's mother died before her time of typhoid fever. Her death so affected the grandmother that she became melancholy, refused to eat, spoke to no one, and, one year after her daughter's death, went out for a walk and never returned; they pulled her corpse out of the Elbe River. Even more learned than my mother's grandfather was her great-grandfather, equally renowned among both Christians and Jews. Once, during a conflagration, his piety worked a miracle; the flames spared his house while devouring all the others around it. He had four sons; one converted to Christianity and became a physician. All of them died young, except for my mother's grandfather. He had one son, whom my mother knew as Crazy Uncle Nathan, and one daughter, my mother's mother.

Subjects; Diana Princess of Wales 1961-1997. Al Fayed, Dodi - Death and burial.</p><p>Within hours of the death of Princess Diana, conspiracy theories began to fly thickly across the Internet. Within 10 days, a book called <i>Who Killed Diana?</i> was on the bookshelves in Cairo, claiming that the princess and her boyfriend Dodi Fayed were assassinated by the British government to ensure that neither Diana, her sons, nor any future children would convert to Islam. In our conspiracy-obsessed age, such a scenario seems as likely as any other currently making the rounds, be it the faked deaths of Elvis and Jim Morrison or aliens stockpiled in a government warehouse, but as authors Thomas Sancton (the <i>Time</i> magazine Paris bureau chief) and Scott MacLeod (the magazine's Middle East correspondent) point out in exhaustive detail, the fatal car accident was almost undoubtedly the result of poor judgment, coincidence, and plain bad luck.<p> The pair conducted interviews with such key figures as Dodi's father, Mohammed, and several of the paparazzi who were first on the scene, and they give a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident, as well as profiles of all the participants, most extensively the driver Henri Paul and the princess's Egyptian boyfriend. Unlike the popular image of a macho cocaine-snorting party guy, Dodi is revealed to have been a sweet and rather insecure figure whose enormous generosity was often taken advantage of. With much personal charisma but little aside from wealth and privilege to mark him as extraordinary, he seems to have been a natural match for his stellar consort. <i>--John Longenbaugh</i></p>THE TRUTH BEHIND THE TRAGEDY <p>Few of us will ever forget the shocking news of August 31, 1997--Lady Diana Spencer, Princess of Wales, had died in a high-speed car crash at the young age of 36. Reports soon confirmed that she and her lover Dodi Fayed were the unlucky victims of a tragic accident. But what really happened on the Paris streets that fateful evening? TIME magazine reporters Thomas Sancton and Scott MacLeod, exhaustively researched the infamous story, and what they unearthed will shock and amaze you. The authors set out to answer these and many other questions: </p><p>-What could EMS workers could have done differently to save Diana? -What was Dodi and Diana's relationship at the time of the crash--were they getting engaged that night? Was Diana pregnant? -How was drunken "stand-in" chauffeur Henri Paul allowed to drive the Princess of Wales to her untimely death? -What did Dodi and Diana's do in their final hours together? -What is the startling assassination theory linking the British government to Diana's death? </p><p>The tranquility of her final resting place contrasted with the tempest of rumors, myths, and interrogations that swirled up in the wake of her death. Even before her body was laid in the ground, word began to spread that she had been pregnant at the time of her death. Under normal circumstances, that would have been a purely private matter--an additional cause for sadness if true, pointless and idle gossip if not. But the violent death of the Princess of Wales was not a normal event. And the question of whether or not she was pregnant is potentially one of the most explosive elements in the investigation, because a pregnancy would give greater credence to the assassination plot theories that began in the Middle East and soon proliferated around the globe.</p></p><h2>Oregon 1859: A Snapshot in Time</h2><p>Oregon became the 33d state in the Union on February 14, 1859.

Garnished with hilarious illustrations and amazing foodie facts, this kid-friendly, globespanning history of our favorite fast-food meal offers unique insight into America's multicultural heritage. From a Roman emperor's snack to a hobo's franks-and-beans, from ballpark treat to astronaut food, there's more wonder in a wiener thank you might think.<p><br><b>&#x201c;Sylver and Smith have created the perfect browsable title about that quintessential kid food.&#x201d; &#x2014;School Library Journal<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;An energetic combination of history and food for thought.&#x201d; &#x2014;Publishers Weekly</b><br>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Adrienne Sylver grew up in Ohio, where she rooted for the Cleveland Indians and learned to appreciate a good stadium hot dog.

Smith lives in Rhinebeck, New York.</p>The fact that there is so much argument about who made the first hot dog says a lot about its appeal. (If you say &#x201c;frank,&#x201d; you're siding with the Frankfurt, Germany, contingent; if you say &#x201c;wiener,&#x201d; you're making the folks in Vienna, Austria, happy.) This zany picture book takes eaters&#x2014;that is, readers&#x2014;through the snack's journey from Roman pig-intestine delicacy to its modern ubiquity at ball parks, cookouts, and dinner tables. Key for the American audience is the nineteenth-century immigration that led to dog stands gaining popularity in hot spots like Coney Island. Sidebars patterned with a retro-cool look clash with the Mad magazine&#x2013;style cartoon art, but the visual chaos is intentional and plays into the mustard-stained mitts of the target audience. Fun facts fly fast and furious: L.A. is America's dog-hungriest city; the wiener equivalent at South African sporting events is beetroot salad. Also included are regional dog differences (get that ketchup off my Chicago Dog!), the rise of the veggie dog, recipes, and plenty of mouth-watering photos. Don't read before lunch.

We had moved to the bar in the corner of the club, but it wasn&#x2019;t much quieter over here.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you drinking?&#x201d;<br><br>She squinted at me. &#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What . . . are . . . you . . . drinking?&#x201d; I screamed over the music.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Teresa held up her glass. The ice cubes jangled in a dark liquid, darker and thicker than Coke. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Red Bull and J�germeister. Here. Try it, El.&#x201d;<br><br>She shoved the glass into my hand. I took a sip, swallowed, and felt my face shrivel up. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s disgusting. That&#x2019;s the worst thing I ever tasted.&#x201d;<br><br>She smiled. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d; She took back the glass and raised it, toasting me.<br><br>The place was called Beach Club, even though it was nowhere near a beach. We were on Second Avenue on the East Side of Manhattan. It was our favorite club, our subterranean hideaway where we escaped nearly every weekend.<br><br>My name is Ellie Saks, and I&#x2019;m twenty-four years old. Why do I need a subterranean hideaway? Don&#x2019;t ask.<br><br>A long metal stairway, dark and kind of creaky, like a subway entrance, led down to the club. And when we got to the bottom, our heels clicking on the rickety metal steps, we found ourselves in this amazing place, all silver and chrome and lights and mirrors.<br><br>Rows of silver tables and booths stretched along both walls, with the dance floor between them. Couples jammed the wide dance floor. Red and white lights pulsed in time to the throbbing dance music.<br><br>An enormous ceiling mirror reflected the dancers and the lights. Following Teresa to the curving chrome bar in the back, I had stared up at the upside-down dancers and thought it might be fun to be up there with them, graceful and oblivious, safe from the chaos below.<br><br>The bar was full, but two tall, long-haired girls in embroidered red halter tops and short shorts stood up just as we arrived, and we grabbed their high-backed stools. I ordered my usual glass of chardonnay. Then I made the mistake of tasting Teresa&#x2019;s drink.<br><br>I kept swallowing, trying to get rid of the taste. &#x201c;It tastes like . . . bubble gum and Robitussin.&#x201d;<br><br>Teresa tilted the glass to her mouth and took a long drink. &#x201c;Hey, you got it. Cough medicine. Yeah.&#x201d; She laughed.<br><br>She has a high, hoarse laugh, sort of like a little boy&#x2019;s. She doesn&#x2019;t look like a little boy, though. She&#x2019;s tall and a little plump, with sexy big green eyes, and piles of long, coppery curls streaked with blond, hair that she&#x2019;s always playing with, tossing from side to side.<br><br>&#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s drinking it. Know who introduced me to it? Ellie, remember Paulo? The guy in the mail room?&#x201d;<br><br>I set my glass of chardonnay down on the bar. &#x201c;You went out with Paulo?&#x201d;<br><br>Teresa nodded, grinning.<br><br>&#x201c;Does he speak English?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure. The bar he took me to was as noisy as this one. I couldn&#x2019;t really hear a word he said. Then we went back to his place. On Avenue A, I think. But he didn&#x2019;t talk much.&#x201d;<br><br>I shook my head. &#x201c;Teresa, why did you go out with him?&#x201d;<br><br>She coiled and uncoiled a thick lock of hair. &#x201c;I wanted to see the rest of his tattoos.&#x201d;<br><br>We both laughed.<br><br>I turned the stem of the wineglass between my fingers. &#x201c;And? Go on. Tell. Did you see them?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded. &#x201c;Yes. But it didn&#x2019;t work out. When I read one that he had down there&#x2014;you know, down there&#x2014;I had to leave.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me? What did it say?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;M-O-M.&#x201d;<br><br>I shouldn&#x2019;t have taken a drink. White wine went spewing out my nose. I was sputtering and choking and laughing, all at the same time.<br><br>The guy next to me turned around. &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d;<br><br>My eyes had teared up, but I could still see that this guy was drop-dead gorgeous. Sort of a young Brad Pitt, with a curl of streaky brown hair falling casually over his forehead and a stubble of beard over his boyish cheeks.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll probably survive,&#x201d; I said, wiping my nose with my hand. I reached for a cocktail napkin on the bar and knocked the wineglass over.<br><br>But he caught it before it spilled.<br><br>&#x201c;Wow. Good hands,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>His blue eyes flashed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better have. I&#x2019;m going to be a surgeon in another two years.&#x201d; He slid the wineglass back to me.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Teresa and I had been hanging out at this club for months. And yet, somehow this was the first time a movie-star surgeon-to-be had said hello to me. Maybe things were looking up.<br><br>He leaned closer, bringing his face close to mine, so close I got a strong whiff of his Gio cologne. He breathed into my ear, &#x201c;Maybe I could operate on you tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>I knew Teresa was watching this whole exchange intently. I could feel her breath on the back of my neck.<br><br>I slid away from the Love Doctor. &#x201c;Could I offer you some advice?&#x201d;<br><br>His eyes narrowed. &#x201c;Advice? You mean, don&#x2019;t ever say that line again?&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>We both laughed. He clinked his Heineken bottle against my wineglass. &#x201c;One-to-nothing, you,&#x201d; he said. He didn&#x2019;t take his blue eyes from mine. He didn&#x2019;t even blink. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re kinda pretty.&#x201d;<br><br>I smiled. &#x201c;So are you.&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t react to that at all. I guess he hears it a lot.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to cut me some slack tonight,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I spent the whole day with cadavers.&#x201d;<br><br>I took a sip of chardonnay. &#x201c;Is that your second-best pickup line?&#x201d;<br><br>I know. I should have been nicer to him. I could feel Teresa&#x2019;s disapproval, feel her eyes burning through the back of my blouse. She&#x2019;d been trying her best to find me a new boyfriend, and here I was, letting her down.<br><br>I took a sip of wine and decided to show some interest. &#x201c;Which med school do you go to?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>He emptied his beer bottle, set it down, and then grinned at me. Perfect teeth, of course. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m taking a home-study course.&#x201d;<br><br>I laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting funnier.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Actually, NYU,&#x201d; he said. He signaled the bartender for another Heineken and ordered another glass of wine for me. He stuck out his hand for me to shake. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Bernie.&#x201d;<br><br>Bernie? With that face? How can he be a Bernie?<br><br>&#x201c;Ellie,&#x201d; I said. His hand was cold from the beer bottle.<br><br>I took a long sip of wine. Someone bumped me from behind. I heard Teresa groan. A hand grabbed my shoulder. &#x201c;Ellie, hey. Here you are.&#x201d;<br><br>I let go of Bernie&#x2019;s hand and spun around. And stared into a familiar face, its red cheeks glistening with sweat, eyes cloudy, furry eyebrows moving up and down rapidly, as if alive.<br><br>&#x201c;Clay? What are you doing here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Looking for you, naturally.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whoa, listen&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Teresa stuck her face between us. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think she wants to see you.&#x201d;<br><br>Clay blinked several times, as if clearing his head. He frowned at Teresa. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;<br><br>He swayed a little, still holding on to my shoulder.<br><br>Clay&#x2019;s friends call him Bear because&#x2014;well, he looks like a bear. He&#x2019;s stocky and broad-chested, with muscular arms and legs, covered with dark brown hair. He has a round, boyish face, with red cheeks you want to pinch. Wiry brown hair on his head, cut short like fur, and round gray eyes under thick brown eyebrows.<br><br>I used to think of him as a cute teddy bear, but I don&#x2019;t now. After I told him I didn&#x2019;t want to go out with him anymore, Clay stopped being cute.<br><br>He started calling me night and day, following me, showing up at my apartment in the middle of the night, totally wasted and strung out, sending flowers and gifts, flooding me with e-mails, begging, pleading.<br><br>It took me a long while to realize he was stalking me. I mean, it&#x2019;s not exactly something that happens to you all the time.<br><br>And then when I finally figured it out, I didn&#x2019;t know how to deal with him. You see, I never meant for it to get serious.<br><br>Clay was one of the first guys I met when I moved to New York. He took me out to restaurants and to Knicks games at the Garden, jazz clubs in the Village. It was great to be living in New York City and have someone to be with on weekends.<br><br>He was an intense kind of guy. But I never stopped to realize how serious he was becoming. And then when I knew I had to get out of it, I tried to explain it all to him. I tried to be nice. I didn&#x2019;t want to hurt him.<br><br>I just wanted him to be gone.<br><br>And now he had his arms around me, and I tumbled off the bar stool. He was holding on to me, grinning, his eyes glassy, unfocused. &#x201c;Just one dance, Ellie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Clay, you&#x2019;re totally wasted, aren&#x2019;t you,&#x201d; I said, struggling to loosen his hold.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe. I guess I&#x2019;m a little fucked up. Hey, I have some little pills we could share.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br><br>He pulled me with both hands. He was very strong. His shirt was open. I could see sweat glistening on his carpet of chest hair. &#x201c;Maybe we could talk. You know. Just . . . talk.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On the dance floor? Clay, I can&#x2019;t hear a thing.&#x201d;<br><br>We stumbled into other dancers. His face grew even redder under the pulsing lights, like a bomb about to explode.<br><br>The music repeated:<br><br>Y&#x2019;all ready for this?<br><br>Y&#x2019;all ready for this?<br><br>No, I&#x2019;m not ready for this. I didn&#x2019;t want to dance with Clay.

In <i>Tanks on the Beaches,</i> Neiman and his coauthor, Kenneth Estes, relay vivid accounts of fighting in the Pacific War, as well as Marine Corps service during the entire World War II period, devoid of idolatry and mythmaking. The result is a war story told from the unique perspective of men fighting from armored machines in desperate battles against a determined enemy. <br><br>After the capture of Guadalcanal, Neiman endured Japanese bombardments there to gather information for his assignment as operations officer of a new tank school being formed in California. He eventually led his own tank company through four island battles culminating in the cauldron of Iwo Jima. Later, he finished the war as executive officer and commanding officer of the 1st Tank Battalion on occupation and security duty in North China in 1945&#x2013;46.<br><br>Neiman and Estes take the reader from prewar training at Quantico and in North Carolina through the delights of a New Zealand bereft of men, the horrors of Saipan and Iwo, the peculiar situation in China after the war, and then the trip back to the States for Neiman&#x2019;s successful postwar career as a lumber retailer. <br><br>Through it all, Estes translates Neiman&#x2019;s eye for the interesting and the human into a multifaceted tale of a young Marine going to war. This is an adventure story with many novel turns that will attract the interest of military experts, military history aficionados, Marine Corps members in general, and veterans of armored fighting vehicle units. Neiman is not a USMC icon, just one of the unheralded thousands of officers who did the real fighting. This is their story, as much as it is his.</p><p>Robert Neiman is retired and now lives in Indian Wells, California.Kenneth Estes is a historian, defense consultant, and former commissioned officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. He lives in Seattle, Washington.&#x201c;Neiman&#x2019;s memoir is a fantastic education about development and use of armor in World War II, and a gritty accounting of some of the most horrific fighting of the war.&#x201d;--Dan Danbom (Dan Danbom)</p><h2>Self Help For the Bleak</h2><p>The comedian and author of the best-selling Sniglets offers hilarious mock-advice on loneliness, being broke, dating, depression, and self-esteem, along with reflections on living marked by his trademark offbeat humor. Original.</p><p>Hall, who won an Emmy Award as a writer for Late Night with David Letterman , delivers a bevy of crackpot advice for coping with life, love, and the elusive pursuit of success. He sees life as four car tires--love, mental and physical health, career, and spirituality--that should be in balance but rarely are. He invents a madcap existence from which his sharply barbed words of wisdom flow. Topics include a failed business ("The House of Index Cards"), a disastrous love affair, and the burden of coping with his Aunt Gretel (a resident at the Harriet Tubman Women's Shelter). Along the way, he intersperses his advice with a manic potpourri of tips, anecdotes, and quotes. This will primarily brighten bleak days for patrons of circulating library who enjoy the offbeat humor of Saturday Night Live (a show on which, incidentally, the author has performed).<br><i>- Carol J.

They set fire to Fred Shoemaker&#x2019;s toolshed, blackmailed Wanda Pierce to get her charm bracelet, and smacked Alice Wendelken across the head. And that&#x2019;s just the start! When the Herdmans show up at church for the free snacks and suddenly take over the Christmas pageant, the other kids are shocked. It&#x2019;s obvious that they&#x2019;re up to no good. But Christmas magic is all around and the Herdmans, who have never heard the Christmas story before, start to reimagine it in their own way.</p><p>This year&#x2019;s pageant is definitely like no other, but maybe that&#x2019;s exactly what makes it so special.</p></p><p><p></p>Hey! Unto you a child is born!<p></p><p>The Herdmans are absolutely the worst kids in the history of the world. They lie and steal and smoke cigars (even the girls). They talk dirty, hit little kids, cuss their teachers, set fire to Fred Shoemaker's old broken-down toolhouse, and take the name of the Lord in vain. So no one is prepared when the Herdmans invade church one Sunday-and decide to take over the annual Christmas pageant.</p><p>None of them has ever heard the Christmas story before. Their interpretation -- the Wise Men are a bunch of dirty spies and Herod needs a good beating-- has a lot of people up in arms. But the actual pageant is full of surprises for everyone, starting with the Herdmans themselves.</p><p>Barbara Robinson has written several popular books for children, including <em>My Brother Louis Measures Worms</em>, <em>The Best School Year Ever</em>, <em>The Best Halloween Ever</em>, and the enormously popular bestselling novel <em>The Best Christmas Pageant Ever</em>, first published in 1972, which was made into a classic TV movie and on which this book was based. The play <em>The Best Christmas Pageant Ever</em> is produced annually in theaters, schools, and churches all over the world. Ms. Robinson has two daughters and three grandchildren.</p></p><h2>Oleander, Jacaranda : A Childhood Perceived</h2><p>This autobiography is about growing up in Egypt. It is also an investigation into childhood perception in which the author uses herself and her memories as an insight into how children see and know. It is a look at Eygpt up to, and including, World War II from a small girl&#39;s point of view, which is also, ultimately, a moving and rather sad picture of an isolated and lonely little girl.</p><p>&#34;Vivid . . . forthright and witty. . . . [Lively] turns her hand to autobiography with the same depth of feeling and meaning that characterizes her fiction.&#34;-- &#34;New York Times Book Review&#34;&#34;The vivid confusions of childhood and the shadings that come with retrospect are seemingly blended.&#34;-- Merle Rubin, &#34;Wall Street Journal&#34;&#34;A quite stunning mediation on the archaeology of memory and time&#39;s predations.&#34;-- &#34;Kirkus Review&#34; (starred review)</p><h2>Death&#39;s Acre: Inside the Legendary Forensic Lab The Body Farm Where the Dead do Tell Tales</h2><p>In this memoir, Bass, a premier forensic anthropologist, recounts how a life spent studying dead bodies led to the creation of &#34;The Anthropolgy Research Facility&#34; (aka the Body Farm), a plot of land near the University of Tennessee Medical Center where Bass and his colleagues monitor the decomposition of human corpses in various environments. The book is structured around the 1981 creation of the Body Farm, and the early chapters focus on some of Bass&#39;s trickier cases to demonstrate his need for more information about the science of forensics. The later chapters take a closer look at how the scientific analysis of Body Farm corpses has helped Bass and other anthropologists solve some of the toughest and most bizarre cases of their distinguished careers. Though professional and conscientious when describing the medical facts of each case, Bass, writing with journalist Jefferson, proves to be a witty storyteller with a welcome sense of humor. He also does a nice job balancing accounts of death and decomposition with decidedly not-so-morbid tidbits from his personal life. Furthermore, the poignancy of how he reacts to the deaths of his first two wives reflects the compassion he feels for the dead and their surviving family members he encounters in his working life. Bass may deal with the dead, but he has a lust for life that comes across in his writing. While the grisly details may not make this a must-read for everyone, those who do pick it up might just be pleasantly surprised by how Bass brings death to life.

Wilderness guide and author Don Thomas offers a series of personal ecological reflections on subjects as grand as the grizzly, as controversial as the wolf and as obscure as the upland plover. From native lore and the observations of Lewis and Clark to the present day, Thomas traces the history of human attitudes toward the region's wildlife.

Four days out on a much-anticipated maiden voyage, the luxury vessel has been fatally grazed by an iceberg.</p> <p>Labeled "unsinkable" by an adoring public, <em>Titanic</em> will plunge beneath the cold waters of the North Atlantic in under three hours.</p> <p>Why does the sinking of the <em>Titanic</em> continue to fascinate us over 100 years after its fateful voyage? Few other tragedies continue to pique our interest and create present-day applications to human behavior. The focus here is about leadership regarding the <em>Titanic</em>, the <em>Californian</em>, and the <em>Carpathia</em>, with each captain demonstrating unique approaches that played key roles in the final outcome of this historic event. The implications for Christian leadership unfold as we observe how each captain addressed the realities they faced. The <em>Titanic</em> is more than history. It remains a prophetic message and clarion call for leaders to choose what values will shape their lives.</p> <p>The questions are personal, the answers, crucial. Will we heed the warning to put salvation before gleaming monuments? May God help us board the right ship!</p></p><p>I suppose you could say that I had to write this book. After looking at photographs of the wreck and reading detailed history, I found myself nearly obsessed with the amazing principles which stuck out as warnings to the present-day church. As a pastor for over thirty years, Titanic Warning is not about criticizing the Church, but sounding a call to bring us back to Christ's mission of discipling the nations. Read it, pray about the things God shows you and commit yourself afresh to reaching friends, neighbors and families with the good news of Christ. <br><br>For more information, visit my website @ caseysabella.com.

Terror Assaulter must defeat Terror at all costs, as long as it leaves time for steamy dates with hot chicks. The man&#x2019;s codename is O.M.W.O.T. (One Man War On Terror) and he is the world&#x2019;s greatest protector, and a villain&#x2019;s worst nightmare. This is a hilarious satire of American foreign policy over the last decade, neocon philosophy, the state of American masculinity and sexuality, and male power fantasy in escapist entertainment.</p><p>Benjamin Marra received a B.F.A. in Illustration from Syracuse University; studied in Florence, Italy; and earned his M.F.A. degree in Illustration from the School of Visual Arts. He currently resides in Toronto.&#x201c;The Most Badass Graphic Novel Ever Created... It can be read as a trenchant spoof of the jingoistic Bush years or of Z-grade 80&#x2019;s action films... or it can be read as the worrisome notebook doodles of a demented teenager. Whatever it is, you probably haven&#x2019;t read anything like it before.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dan Meth, <em>Buzzfeed</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;...Marra expresses his hero&#x2019;s hyper-exaggerated masculinity... through in the combination of over-the-top fight choreography and quippy dialogue, casting the lead character a wise-cracking action hero. It&#x2019;s a role that is highlighted by Marra&#x2019;s art, which juggles grisly killings with sensational action beats and bursts of dark comedy and sexual relief.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Oliver Sava, <em>The A.V. Club</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s quite possible that&nbsp;<em>OMWOT</em>&nbsp;isn&#x2019;t interested in categorization, or explanation, or order. It might just be an exercise in nihilism and narrative chaos. And the thing is, no matter how you read it &#x2015; as a narrative with more to deliver, as a satire of bad comics, as an exercise in emphasizing ugliness &#x2015;&nbsp;<em>OMWOT</em>&nbsp;succeeds. It works on every level you try to categorize it under, because it feels, on some level, spiritually pure. It is what it is, because it&#x2019;s devoted to telling its disturbing story of sex and violence with a completely straight face.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Paul Constant, <em>The Seattle Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;...[S]uper-sexy, uber-sleazy, super-weird... I can&#x2019;t think of another book that feels like a Peter Saul painting, reads like the diary of someone&#x2019;s darkest fantasy, and never for a second lets you forget that it&#x2019;s the most unreal version of a 'realistic' subject ever put to paper. Like a pop song written by a masterful craftsman, there&#x2019;s never a verse that goes on too long or loses the overall rhythm, even when he&#x2019;s riffing off into a Hendrix-like frenzy of spontaneity and power chords. The book builds to a complete orchestral crescendo, making its message about the retarded nature of a mind that thrives on pulp violence unmistakably clear. Everything he is hinting at about how this phenomenon is at the center of modern American culture is pretty clear too.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Josh Bayer, <em>Bin Crawler</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;If you can imagine&nbsp;Fletcher Hanks&nbsp;collaborating with&nbsp;Larry Hama&nbsp;or&nbsp;Chuck Dixon&nbsp;on a&nbsp;Jack Kirby-inspired, deadpan&nbsp;<em>G.I. Joe</em>&nbsp;parody that was serialized in the back of&nbsp;<em>Playboy</em>&nbsp;in the late 1980s, well, you&#x2019;d be pretty darn close to what Marra has come up with here. You&#x2019;d just have to multiply that by a factor of 10 or 20. It&#x2019;s not for everyone, obviously, but is it any good? Let&#x2019;s just say... 'Yes, it&#x2019;s good.'&#x201d;<br> - <strong>J. Caleb Mozzocco, <em>ComicsAlliance</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[<em>Terror Assaulter</em>] is an intricately constructed art comic that presents itself as a stripped down, ultra-simplified action comic. Its satirical elements are hilarious, more so because Marra doesn&#x2019;t announce them as satire, he plays the whole thing completely straight. Rendered exclusively in primary colors, it&#x2019;s also a beautifully crafted work, and highly entertaining. Though much of the copious ass kicking and gun blasting in the book is done in the service of Marra&#x2019;s understated satire, it&#x2019;s also a hell of a fun read.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Harris Smith, <em>comiXology</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Super inspiring. A visceral shining beacon of lightning for lesser cartoonists to marvel at. Does what comics are supposed to do, builds a new world, sometimes a better world... a different, cracked-mirror-view world. It's the world so tightly associated with fantasy itself that it says something essential about comics themselves, resonates on the highest frequency the medium is capable of. Or if it can get higher, f--- it, that's too high.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Josh Bayer (Raw Power, Theth), <em>Tech Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;...<em>Terror Assaulter</em> [is] one of the most unique action-based comics to hit the stands in years. ...

The effect reveals a carefully conceived philosophy, expressed with delightful pungency and clarity. The provocative content of these writings still challenges us. His thoughts on social issues, especially on the dangers of religious fundamentalism, are uncannily prescient. A dry and even misanthropic humor lightens his essays, and his reflections on himself and his philosophy reveal a quiet dignity at the core of a man better known for provoking Americans during an era of unprecedented tumult. From the wry "Is the Human Race Getting Anywhere," to the scornful "Patriotism," and his elegaic summing up, "At Seventy-Two," Darrow's writing still stimulates and pleases. Darrow, son of a village undertaker and coffinmaker, rose to become one of America's greatest attorneys&#x2014;and surely its most famous. The Ohio native gained fame for being at the center of momentous trials, including his 1924 defense of Leopold and Loeb and his defense of Darwinian principles in the 1925 Scopes "Monkey Trial." Some have traced Darrow's lifelong campaign against capital punishment to his boyhood terror at seeing a Civil War soldier buried&#x2014;and no client of Darrow's was ever executed, not even black men who were charged with murder for defending themselves against a white mob. A rebel who always sided intellectually and emotionally with the minority, Darrow remains a figure to contend with sixty-seven years after his death. "Inside every lawyer is the wreck of a poet," Darrow once said. Closing Arguments demonstrates that, in his case, that statement is true.</p><p><b>Clarence Darrow</b> (1857 - 1938) was born in northeast Ohio and served as a small-town lawyer there for nine years.

She is best known for the novel Little Women and its sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys. Little Women was set in the Alcott family home, Orchard House in Concord, Massachusetts, and published in 1868. This novel is loosely based on her childhood experiences with her three sisters. Alcott's literary success arrived with the publication by the Roberts Brothers of the first part of Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, a semi-autobiographical account of her childhood with her sisters in Concord, Massachusetts. Part two, or Part Second, also known as Good Wives, followed the March sisters into adulthood and their respective marriages. Little Men detailed Jo's life at the Plumfield School that she founded with her husband Professor Bhaer at the conclusion of Part Two of Little Women. Jo's Boys completed the "March Family Saga". In Little Women, Alcott based her heroine "Jo" on herself. But whereas Jo marries at the end of the story, Alcott remained single throughout her life. In her later life, Alcott became an advocate for women's suffrage and was the first woman to register to vote in Concord, Massachusetts, in a school board election. Alcott, along with Elizabeth Stoddard, Rebecca Harding Davis, Anne Moncure Crane, and others, were part of a group of female authors during the Gilded Age who addressed women&#x2019;s issues in a modern and candid manner. Alcott, who continued to write until her death, suffered chronic health problems in her later years. Alcott died of a stroke in Boston, on March 6, 1888, at age 55, two days after visiting her father's deathbed. Her last words were "Is it not meningitis?"</p><h2>Stories from Puerto Rico / Historias de Puerto Rico (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p><p><b>Dive into the tales of Puerto Rico--in Spanish and in English!</b></p> <p>In <i>Stories from Spain/Historias de Puerto Rico</i>, we've placed the Spanish and English stories side by side--<i>lado a lado</i>--so you can practice and improve your reading skills in your new language while enjoying the support of your native language.

Midnight Call Editor Arno Froese has tackled a great many challenging questions in the magazine's most popular feature. Readers have enjoyed the opportunity to write in and pose various questions and concerns relative to the Body of Christ, and have benefitted from Arno's concise scriptural responses on topics such as the Rapture of the Church, globalism, the Ecumenical Movement, false religions, eschatology, general Scripture explanations and much more. Each answer is thoughtful, carefully researched and answered based on what the Bible teaches. <p>Where else can you find such a wide variety of subjects responded to and available all in one place? Chances are, questions that may have bothered you for years have been asked and addressed in this book. </p><p>Letters to the Editor contains a detailed table of contents to help the reader find exactly what they are looking for! </p><p>Wisdom, knowledge, discernment and a mastery of the Scriptures has enabled Arno to assist individual believers in the Body of Christ in virtually every aspect of their walk with the Lord and their understanding of the Scriptures. </p><p>Find out for yourself why the "Letters to the Editor" column is the number one feature of Midnight Call magazine!</p></p><p>Letters to the Editor is a book that is true to its title, and one which I consider the voice of the Church. Because our letter writers are not only national, but international, we can assume that virtually all churches and denominations are represented. Therefore, opinions and views will vary due to the influence of denominational guidelines. However, it is fair to say that a large percentage of our writers are concerned readers who have been motivated to respond, in agreement or disagreement, to certain issues that have been addressed in our Midnight Call magazine. Thus, we have taken great pains to publish virtually all letters in their entirety. Thus, the largest contributors to this book are our letter writers, a voice that will be heard throughout these pages. <p>Although we have changed the names and initials of the writers to protect their privacy, all letters are original, with minor editorial revisions having been made only when necessary for clarity or grammatical purposes. </p><p>The variety of letter writers representing many different backgrounds and nationalities is what makes this book so unique. With this in mind, I would like to thank those who wrote for being my teachers. This is important to emphasize becase it was the letter writer who caused me to search the Scriptures and find answers to numerous questions. They prompted me to refine my answers, seek additional scriptural proof and ground my understanding in the eternal Word of God. The way they responded to my answers enriched me with their views. </p><p>Of the thousands of letters I have received since I entered the minisrty in 1968 under the leadership of the late Dr. Wim Malgo, this book represents only a small fraction; however, the letters selected represent a unified voice of the Church expressing various opinions. </p><p>I am humbled to admit that in some cases my answers may come across as impolite, sarcastic, or somewhat self-righteous. However, this was never the true intention of my heart. Rarely have I ever replied to someone without revising my response before putting it in the mail. The motive behind all my answers, as well as that behind my life and ministry, is to proclaim the truth of the Bible to the best of my knowledge and ability. I have done my utmost to base my answers on the simplicity of Scripture, the ultimate authority for all Christians. </p><p>As mentioned earlier, the letters published in this book have been selected from several years of letters which have appeared in Midnight Call magazine. We have attempted to categorize them according to subject matter and content. Although a number of letters deal with the same subject, each letter has been answered on an individual basis, without reference to, or comparison with previous answers. </p><p>My response to each question or opinion has not been based on the framework of certain seminaries or popular schools of thought, but, as already mentioned, I have attempted to let the Bible speak for itself. The knowledge I have gained since entering the ministry by answering thousands of letters is really quite impossible for me to comprehend. One thing is absolutely clear: I have learned a great deal from my readers, friends and foes alike, who have often caused me to change my view on certain subjects at certain times, and at others, who have helped me to gain a deeper insight by further intense study. However, I have never changed my mind regarding the truth of Scripture; it is plain and clear in context and in no need of interpretation or further analysis. </p><p>Although according to Bible prophecy, knowledge is being increased and the speed of accumulating scientific knowledge, particularly in electronics, is explosive, I have adhered to the motto of Midnight Call Ministry founder, Dr. Wim Malgo, "The Bible is the best commentary to the Bible." </p><p>In conclusion, I must highlight one more important point, namely, the uniqueness of each person as created in the image of God. This uniqueness enables us to see various things from different perspectives. Therefore, we shouldn't expect to agree on everything. Even members of the first church and the apostles amongst themselves did not always agree on all matters at all times. We know that Paul had to correct Peter and bluntly told him that he was in error. When reading the book of Acts, we notice that Paul and Barnabas "...had no small dissension and disputation: with certain disciples from Judea. Verse 7 says, "...there had been much disputing." On this occasion, the apostle James took the lead and said, "Simeon hath declared God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. And to these agree the words of the prophets; as it is written" (Acts 15:14-15). Thus we see that the answer to the disputation was "the words of the prophets," the writ! ten Word of God. Even great co-workers in the kingdom of God such as Paul and Barnabas had a difference of opinions, "And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus" (verse 39). Therefore, living together in peaceful harmony at all times is not necessarily required and this truth is clearly shown to us in the example given in Scripture. </p><p>We may have differences of opinions, and our interpretations of difficult Scriptures will vary; however, regardless of our differences as believers, the direction of our unity must never be solely on a person-to-person level. Instead, the direction we must take in order to arrive at perfect unity must be vertical. We are one in Him and only in Him are we one. </p><p>Addressing the church, Paul made the following statement, "Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God" (Romans 15:5-7). It is absolutely essential that our desire for unity is centered on one person, "likeminded one toward another with one mind receive ye one another" and is built upon the foundation "as Christ also received us to the glory of God." Jesus made this unity of the Church clear in His high priestly prayer, "that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one" (John 17:22-23). Therefore, unity in Jesus must be the goal of our lives, the Church, our ministry and this book. </p><p>I pray that the pages of this book will contribute to fulfilling Paul's admonition to his spiritual son Timothy, "reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine" (2nd Timothy 4:2).</p>Arno Froese is the Executive Director of Midnight Call Ministry and Editor of the critically-acclaimed prophetic magazine, Midnight Call, which is internationally distributed in German, Dutch, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Hungarian, Romanian, Russian, Korean, Bengali, and English.

Martin L. Weitzman, one of America&#x2019;s leading economic theorists, has hit upon a central feature of our economic life as the cause of this chronic malady: the standard practice of paying workers a fixed wage, regardless of whether a company is doing well or poorly. Weitzman shows in a clear straightforward way that an alternative labor payment system, in which a significant number of firms share profits or revenues with their employees (like the Japanese bonus system), provides immunity against stagflation; an economy of such firms automatically soaks up unemployed labor and resists inflation.</p><p>Under the Weitzman system, firms always have an incentive to take on more workers because the additional worker is paid only a fraction or share of the revenue he brings into the firm. General Motors and Eastern Airlines have already taken steps to implement profit and revenue sharing. Here, for the first time, is a lucid explanation and justification of share systems. Eschewing theoretically unsound schemes such as supply-side tax cuts and industrial policy on the one hand and macroeconomic sledgehammer &#x201c;cures&#x201d; on the other, <i>The Share Economy</i> provides a powerful and hopeful account of what may become the most important economic innovation of our time.</p></p><p>Martin L.

Through her retelling of the historic moment of their first meeting, Middlebrook sets the balanced, literate, and brutally honest tone that she maintains throughout the book. According to Middlebrook, Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes&#x2019;s first encounter was violent and almost mythic, punctuated with kisses and biting. In 112 days they were married. Together, as Middlebrook shows, they formed a unique literary bond. They remained aggressive intellectual and erotic partners. But, six years later, Hughes left Plath and their two children for another woman. She committed suicide shortly after, while Hughes would go on to a long and successful career as a poet and as Plath&#x2019;s literary executor. <p> What Middlebrook brings to this story, outside of the almost voyeuristic details gleaned from letters, diaries, interviews, and past biographies, is a scholarly commitment to infuse the reading of Hughes and Plath&#x2019;s marriage with a reading of their poetry and prose. In less capable hands, using literature to reconstruct biography can lead to an undisciplined avoidance of real historical research. But Middlebrook drafts the writings to bolster her understanding of the couple in sophisticated ways that link their private language to their public statements in published works (especially Hughes&#x2019; <i>Birthday Letters</i>). At the same time, Middlebrook remains deeply aware that Hughes and Plath worked to re-construct themselves through their writings, often with conflicting self-portraits, for posterity. She is comfortable letting their contradictions exist side by side. </p><p> <i>Her Husband</i> is wonderfully told; it is difficult to imagine how this narrative of the marriage could be surpassed. One only hopes that Middlebrook will have the stamina to amend her own work&#x2014;if necessary&#x2014;when Hughes&#x2019;s most private papers are made public in 2023. <i>--Patrick O&#x2019;Kelley</i></p>Diane Middlebrook is the author of two highly praised, bestselling biographies, <i>Suits Me: The Double Life of Billy Tipton</i> and <i>Anne Sexton: A Biography</i>, which was a National Book Award and was a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist.<br><br>Diane Middlebrook is a former professor at Stanford University.</p><h2>Hello Kitty, Hello Everything: 25 Years of Fun</h2><p>A lavishly illustrated volume explores the world of Hello Kitty since her first appearance in 1974, describing her family, friends, and interests while showing the many collectibles that bear her resemblance.</p><p></p><h2>Chi&#39;s Sweet Home, volume 8</h2><p>In the eighth volume of Chi's Sweet Home, Chi is growing up and now that she has a sense of her new surroundings, the little shorthair is ready to make this new neighborhood her own.

Miranda has become a household word; now Gary Stuart tells the inside story of this famous case, and with it the legal history of the accused&#x2019;s right to counsel and silence. Ernesto Miranda was an uneducated Hispanic man arrested in 1963 in connection with a series of sexual assaults, to which he confessed within hours. He was convicted not on the strength of eyewitness testimony or physical evidence but almost entirely because he had incriminated himself without knowing it and without knowing that he didn&#x2019;t have to. Miranda&#x2019;s lawyers, John P. Frank and John F. Flynn, were among the most prominent in the state, and their work soon focused the entire country on the issue of their client&#x2019;s rights. A 1966 Supreme Court decision held that Miranda&#x2019;s rights had been violated and resulted in the now-famous "Miranda warnings." Stuart personally knows many of the figures involved in Miranda, and here he unravels its complex history, revealing how the defense attorneys created the argument brought before the Court and analyzing the competing societal interests involved in the case. He considers <i>Miranda</i>'s aftermath not only the test cases and ongoing political and legal debate but also what happened to Ernesto Miranda. He then updates the story to the Supreme Court&#x2019;s 2000 <i>Dickerson</i> decision upholding Miranda and considers its implications for cases in the wake of 9/11 and the rights of suspected terrorists. Interviews with 24 individuals directly concerned with the decision lawyers, judges, and police officers, as well as suspects, scholars, and ordinary citizens offer observations on the case&#x2019;s impact on law enforcement and on the rights of the accused. Ten years after the decision in the case that bears his name, Ernesto Miranda was murdered in a knife fight at a Phoenix bar, and his suspected killer was "Mirandized" before confessing to the crime. <i>Miranda: The Story of America&#x2019;s Right to Remain Silent</i> considers the legacy of that case and its fate in the twenty-first century as we face new challenges in the criminal justice system.</p><p>Gary L. Stuart is a nationally recognized author and lecturer on trial advocacy, ethics, and professional responsibility whose books include <i>The Ethical Trial Lawyer, Ethical Litigation,</i> and most recently the historical novel <i>The Gallup 14</i>. He was a partner in one of Arizona's largest law firms, Jennings, Strouss &amp; Salmon, P.L.C., from 1967 through 1998 and now practices law part-time.It seems odd to think of it, but a suspect's right to remain silent is only four decades old. Well, that's not precisely true: U.S. citizens have had the right not to incriminate themselves for some time, but it was not until the 1963 case of <i>Miranda v. Arizona</i> that advising a suspect of the right to remain silent became encoded in law. When told he had been identified by a witness, Ernesto Miranda, an accused serial rapist, figured he might as well fess up. He didn't know he had the right to keep his mouth shut because the police officers hadn't told him. That simple, seemingly insignificant incident changed the American legal system in a massive way. The author, an attorney and law professor who knew many of the people involved in the Miranda case and its aftermath, tells the story simply, making even the most complicated and subtle legal points entirely clear. He also explores how the Miranda decision affects law enforcement in the post-9/11 world. Interesting, timely, and important. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Divorced with a young child, and fearful of going mad, Anna records her experiences in four coloured notebooks: black for her writing life, red for political views, yellow for emotions, blue for everyday events. But it is a fifth notebook the golden notebook that finally pulls these wayward strands of her life together.Widely regarded as Doris Lessings masterpiece and one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, The Golden Notebook is wry and perceptive, bold and indispensable.</p><p>Much to its author's chagrin, <i>The Golden Notebook</i> instantly became a staple of the feminist movement when it was published in 1962. Doris Lessing's novel deconstructs the life of Anna Wulf, a sometime-Communist and a deeply leftist writer living in postwar London with her small daughter. Anna is battling writer's block, and, it often seems, the damaging chaos of life itself. The elements that made the book remarkable when it first appeared--extremely candid sexual and psychological descriptions of its characters and a fractured, postmodern structure--are no longer shocking. Nevertheless, <i>The Golden Notebook</i> has retained a great deal of power, chiefly due to its often brutal honesty and the sheer variation and sweep of its prose.<p> This largely autobiographical work comprises Anna's four notebooks: "a black notebook which is to do with Anna Wulf the writer; a red notebook concerned with politics; a yellow notebook, in which I make stories out of my experience; and a blue notebook which tries to be a diary." In a brilliant act of verisimilitude, Lessing alternates between these notebooks instead of presenting each one whole, also weaving in a novel called <i>Free Women</i>, which views Anna's life from the omniscient narrator's point of view. As the novel draws to a close, Anna, in the midst of a breakdown, abandons her dependence on compartmentalization and writes the single golden notebook of the title.</p><p> In tracking Anna's psychological movements--her recollections of her years in Africa, her relationship with her best friend, Molly, her travails with men, her disillusionment with the Party, the tidal pull of motherhood--Lessing pinpoints the pulse of a generation of women who were waiting to see what their postwar hopes would bring them. What arrived was unprecedented freedom, but with that freedom came unprecedented confusion. Lessing herself said in a 1994 interview: "I say fiction is better than telling the truth. Because the point about life is that it's a mess, isn't it? It hasn't got any shape except for you're born and you die." </p><p> <i>The Golden Notebook</i> suffers from certain weaknesses, among them giving rather simplistic, overblown illustrations to the phrase "a good man is hard to find" in the form of an endless parade of weak, selfish men. But it still has the capacity to fill emotional voids with the great rushes of feeling it details. Perhaps this is because it embodies one of Anna's own revelations: "I've been forced to acknowledge that the flashes of genuine art are all out of deep, suddenly stark, undisguiseable private emotion. Even in translation there is no mistaking these lightning flashes of genuine personal feeling." It seems that Lessing, like Anna when she decides to abandon her notebooks for the single, golden one, attempted to put all of herself in one book. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>doris lessing is widely recognized as one of the greatest writers of the second half of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Baby of the Family</h2><p>An evocative, delicately comic story of a girl�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s coming of age.

A frequent contributor to the Los Angeles Times, Newsday, and Atlanta Journal-Constitution, she can be seen on the CBS News Sunday Morning segment &#34;Postcards from Georgia.&#34; She lives with her husband on St. Simons Island, Georgia.In this engaging coming-of-age novel by a new black writer, young Lena McPherson leads a charmed life, secure in her family and in the world Ansa evokes. Born in 1949 in a private blacks-only hospital in rural Georgia, Lena is the third child and longed-for first daughter of Nellie and Jonah, who own the local bar and liquor store. Considered "special" because she was born with a caul, believed to bestow sight into the future, Lena learns as a toddler that her special powers have more to do with the past: she can see and talk with ghosts. Despite her extraordinary talent, Lena is most memorable for the ordinariness of her everyday life. Following Lena's first friendships, her years at school, her observations of her parents' sometimes stormy relationship, her grief at her grandmother's death, Ansa beautifully renders Lena's stable, well-off world. Readers get a view of middle-class black small-town life in the relatively placid mid-century, a time when a grandmother scorns the black families who vacation at the beach, and where a little girl often feels her life is dictated solely by demands that she keep her hair dry and combed. Ansa's thorough and affectionate portrait marks her as a writer of both promise and achievement. <br> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> )<br><br>YA-- A coming-of-age novel with ethnic and supernatural threads that weave reality with the mystical. Born in Georgia in the late 1950s, Lena McPherson was special at birth--she was born with a caul or veil over her face, indicating the presence of magical and psychic powers. Young adults are sure to relate to Lena as she grows up with her family, her peers, and the other adults who frequent her parents' successful bar and liquor store business. Besides the human characters, Lena also learns to deal with apparitions that only she can see, such as Rachel, a young slave who gives Lena insight into what slavery was like and the emotional effects it had on the individual. Ansa's dialogue is realistic, and her characters are colorful. The supernatural elements are well blended into the novel, adding to the richness of the fiction.<br><i>- Krystal K.

Ever since she went missing, he's been consumed with finding out what happened to her. Finally, he may be moving on. He has fallen in love and is going to marry his girlfriend, Cleo, who is pregnant with their child. &nbsp;But his life is put on hold when, after a wild New Year's Eve ball, a woman is brutally raped as she returns to her hotel room. A week later, another woman is attacked. Both victims' shoes are taken by their attacker. Grace soon realizes that these new cases bear remarkable similarities to an unsolved series of crimes in the city back in 1997. The perpetrator had been dubbed "Shoe Man" and was believed to have raped four women before murdering his fifth victim and vanishing. Could this be a copycat, or has Shoe Man resurfaced?&nbsp;When more women are assaulted, Grace becomes increasingly certain that they are dealing with the same man.

Mostly trivial stuff, like forgetting to return a phone call, or to put money in a parking meter, or to pick up milk at the supermarket. But sometimes &#x2013; luckily very rarely &#x2013; we make the big one.</p><p>The kind of mistake that could cost us our life.</p><p>The kind of mistake Rachael Ryan made.</p><p>And she had a long time to reflect on it.</p><p>If...she had been less drunk. If...it hadn&#x2019;t been so sodding freezing cold. If...it hadn&#x2019;t begun to rain. If...there hadn&#x2019;t been a queue of a hundred equally drunk revellers at the taxi rank in Brighton&#x2019;s East Street at 2 a.m. on Christmas Eve, or, rather, Christmas morning. If...her flat had not been within walking distance, unlike her equally drunk companions, Tracey and Jade, who lived far away, on the other side of the city.</p><p>If...she had listened to Tracey and Jade telling her not to be so bloody stupid. That there were plenty of taxis. That it would only be a short wait.</p><p></p><p>His whole body stiffened with excitement. After two hours of watching, finally the woman he had been waiting for was turning into the street. She was on foot and alone. Perfect!</p><p>She was wearing a miniskirt with a shawl around her shoulders and looked a little unsteady on her legs, from drink and probably from the height of the heels. She had nice legs. But what he was really looking at was her shoes. His kind of shoes. High-heeled with ankle straps. He liked ankle straps. As she came closer, approaching beneath the sodium glare of the street lights, he could see, through his binoculars, through the rear window, that they were shiny, as he had hoped.</p><p>Very sexy shoes!</p><p>She was his kind of woman!</p><p></p><p>God, was she glad she had decided to walk! What a queue! And every taxi that had gone past since was occupied. With a fresh, windy drizzle on her face, Rachael tottered along past the shops on St James&#x2019;s Street, past the Royal Sussex County Hospital, then turned right into Paston Place, where the wind became stronger, batting her long brown hair around her face. She headed down towards the seafront, then turned left into her street of Victorian terraced houses, where the wind and the rain played even more havoc with her hairdo. Not that she cared any more, not tonight. In the distance she heard the wail of a siren, an ambulance or a police car, she thought.</p><p>She walked past a small car with misted windows. Through them she saw the silhouette of a couple snogging, and she felt a twinge of sadness and a sudden yearning for Liam, whom she had dumped almost six months ago now. The bastard had been unfaithful. OK, he had pleaded with her to forgive him, but she just knew he would stray again, and again &#x2013; he was that sort. All the same, she missed him a lot at times, and she wondered where he was now. What he was doing tonight. Who he was with. He&#x2019;d be with a girl for sure.</p><p>Whereas she was on her own.</p><p>She and Tracey and Jade. The Three Saddo Singles, they jokingly called themselves. But there was a truth that hurt behind the humour. After two and a half years in a relationship with the man she had really believed was the one she would marry, it was hard to be alone again. Particularly at Christmas, with all its memories.</p><p>God, it had been a shitty year. In August, Princess Diana had died. Then her own life had fallen apart.</p><p>She glanced at her watch. It was 2.35. Tugging her mobile phone from her bag, she rang Jade&#x2019;s number. Jade said they were still waiting in the queue. Rachael told her she was almost home. She wished her a merry Christmas. Told her to wish Tracey a merry Christmas too, and said she&#x2019;d see them New Year&#x2019;s Eve.</p><p>&#x2018;Hope Santa&#x2019;s good to you, Rach!&#x2019; Jade said. &#x2018;And tell him not to forget the batteries if he brings you a vibrator!&#x2019;</p><p>She heard Tracey cackling in the background.</p><p>&#x2018;Sod off!&#x2019; she said with a grin.</p><p>Then she slipped the phone back into her bag and stumbled on, nearly coming a purler as one high heel of her incredibly expensive Kurt Geigers, which she&#x2019;d bought last week in a sale, caught between two paving stones. She toyed for a moment with the idea of taking them off, but she was almost home now. She tottered on.</p><p>The walk and the rain had sobered her up a little, but she was still too drunk, and too coked up, not to think it was odd that at almost three on Christmas morning a man in a baseball cap a short distance in front of her was trying to lug a fridge out of a van.</p><p>He had it half out and half in as she approached. She could see he was struggling under its apparent weight and suddenly he cried out in pain.</p><p>Instinctively, because she was kind, she ran, stumbling, up to him.</p><p>&#x2018;My back! My disc! My disc has gone! Oh, Jesus!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Can I help?&#x2019;</p><p>It was the last thing she remembered saying.</p><p>She was hurled forward. Something wet slapped across her face. She smelt a sharp, acrid reek.</p><p>Then she blacked out.</p><p>DEAD LIKE YOU Copyright � 2010 by Really Scary Books/Peter James</p></p><h2>Environmental Psychology: Principles and Practice</h2><p>Optimal: The Book and The Team Optimal Books, a division of Optimal Environments, Inc., is the publisher of Robert Gifford&#39;s textbook, Environmental Psychology: Principles and Practice, now in its 5th edition.

The only break in the Pan-American Highway, which runs from Alaska to the tip of South America, it is an almost impregnable strip of swamp, jungle, and cloud forest between the land masses of North and South America. Stories of abduction and murder there are rife and in recent years more people have successfully climbed Everest or trekked to the South Pole than have crossed the Dari�n Gap.<br>In 2000, Tom Hart Dyke, a young botanist, set off to Central America with one thing in mind: orchids. He knew that in order to find the rare and beautiful species he so fervently admired, he would have to visit some of the most inhospitable places on earth. Unbeknownst to Tom, another young explorer, Paul Winder, was backpacking through the area at the same time. Though he sometimes worked freelance in the City of London, Paul was a fearless and intrepid traveler, happier scaling volcanoes than lounging on beaches. In every bar and caf� along his route, rumors abounded of the Dari�n Gap - and the more he heard, the greater became his desire to make the journey. Pure chance brought Paul and Tom together in northern Mexico; they formed an instant bond and their fate was sealed.<br>Ignoring a final succinct warning from the Lonely Planet Guide - &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even think about it!&#x201d; - Tom and Paul set off into the Dari�n. Tom in search of orchids, Paul in search of adventure. They would find plenty of each. For six days, they made good progress. Then, just hours away from Colombia, the dream ended and the horror began. Paul and Tom were ambushed by FARC guerillas, who were to hold them hostage for the next nine months. From that day on, their survival was a matter of extraordinary endurance, incredible ingenuity - and not a little good luck . . .<br>Tom Hart Dyke is a botanist with a wild enthusiasm for orchids.

It was what he did not say that spoke most powerfully to the mob that morning. It was a cup of cold water for a thirsty adulteress and an ice-cold drenching in the face to a group of angry Pharisees.&#34;To this day we have not the slightest idea what it was Jesus twice scribbled in the sand. By and large the commentaries have asked the wrong question through the ages. They labor over the content, over what he might have written. They ask what without ever realizing that the real question is why. It was not the content that mattered but why he did it. Unexpected. Irritating. Creative.&#34; (From chapter one)Singer, songwriter and diligent student of Scripture, Michael Card is well known for the depth of his lyrics and the artistry of his music. But far more significant than the songs he has penned is the source of his inspiration--the creativity embodied in Jesus Christ, the incarnate Word of God.In this book Card explores the biblical foundations of true Christian creativity. Whether we think of ourselves as creative or not, all of us are created in the image of our Creator God, and thus creativity is a vital expression of our discipleship. With Jesus as his model, Card shows how understanding God?s creative imagination leads to a lifestyle of humility, obedience and servanthood. And he invites us to follow God&#39;s creative call through worship and community.Through Jesus, God has spoken to us in a word we can understand. Likewise, Michael Card has articulated the story of Jesus to others through his own scribblings in the sand. This book shows us how we can do the same.</p><p>"Every song I've heard Michael sing makes me think about Jesus. Every moment I've spent with Michael makes me think about Jesus. Who better, then, to make us all think more highly of Christ than Michael Card. May God use this book to do exactly that in your life." Max Lucado, author <p>"When Michael Card speaks on Christian creativity, the world listens. I think they listen first because he is a Christian whose faith is his reason to be. I think they listen next because he is creative. In every sentence he writes, his appetite for beauty devours his soul and leaves the rest of us hungry to acquire his taste. I think I personally admire him because he lives in that Promethean torture chamber where mediocrity is offensive and excellence exceeds the grasp. Yet it is his reaching toward aesthetic wonders that refreshes us with a widening vision of Christ. Then having caught the greater view of things, he generously passes the vision forward to us all." Calvin Miller, author of The Singer Trilogy </p><p>"This book reached my heart as few others. Every artist (which means every Christian) needs to meditate on Michael Card's message, not just read, but ponder, reflect, pray. The result will be a thrilling release of the Spirit from depths you hadn't before realized were there. At least, that's what happened in me." Larry Crabb, author of Inside Out </p><p>"Countless books circulate on what it means to be 'creative,' on what 'art' is; relatively few are written from a distinctively Christian perspective. There cannot be many more qualified than Michael Card to fill this glaring gap. Here we learn, powerfully, that creativity, rightly conceived, is a response to God: it is worship. To his own evocative reflections Michael Card appends the musing of several other Christian artists and critics. This is a book to be cherished and savored." D. A. Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School</p>Michael Card is an award-winning musician, performing artist and the writer of such songs as &#34;El Shaddai&#34; and &#34;Immanuel.&#34; He has produced over twenty albums, including Scribbling in the Sand: The Best of Michael Card Live.

In the outpouring of proud stories that followed, African-American women shared their experiences, smashed stereotypes, and recorded the untold story of African-American life in bold, defiant anthology fiction.<br><br>This stunning anthology begins with Harper's original story and chronicles the literary journey of African-American women to the present day -- from "As the Lord Lives, He Is One of our Mother's Children," Pauline E.

Although some authors?e.g., Rita Dove, Alice Walker, Ann Petry?appear in both works, there is no repetition of material, and each title contains stories by many less-familiar authors. There are a few major differences in emphasis. Revolutionary Tales is chronological, starting in 1859, and its focus is the work of African American women. Children of the Night includes male and female authors, stressing the period 1967 to the present. The former has useful annotations at the beginning of each piece, while the latter has tried to provide a sequel to the well-received short story collection of 1969 (Best Short Stories by Black Writers), edited by Langston Hughes. In her editor's note, Naylor (Bailey's Cafe, LJ 9/1/92) makes it clear that her choices are bound together by differing treatment of the same subject and by geographic location. Both books include biographical information about their respective contributors, but Revolutionary Tales is more detailed. Readers who want a glimpse of the breadth of African American life will not be disappointed by either work. If there is room in your library budget, buy copies of both.?Susan M.

She shows that the clash between nascent Islam and stubburn Byzantium was the central contest that allowed "Europe" to develop, and she thereby places the rise of the West in its true Mediterranean context. Her inquiry centers on the notion of "Christendom." Instead of taking medieval beliefs for granted or separating theology from politics, she treats the faith as a material force.

To capture the geisha experience in the art of fiction, Golden trained as long and hard as any geisha who must master the arts of music, dance, clever conversation, crafty battle with rival beauties, and cunning seduction of wealthy patrons. After earning degrees in Japanese art and history from Harvard and Columbia--and an M.A. in English--he met a man in Tokyo who was the illegitimate offspring of a renowned businessman and a geisha. This meeting inspired Golden to spend 10 years researching every detail of geisha culture, chiefly relying on the geisha Mineko Iwasaki, who spent years charming the very rich and famous.<p> The result is a novel with the broad social canvas (and love of coincidence) of Charles Dickens and Jane Austen's intense attention to the nuances of erotic maneuvering. Readers experience the entire life of a geisha, from her origins as an orphaned fishing-village girl in 1929 to her triumphant auction of her <i>mizuage</i> (virginity) for a record price as a teenager to her reminiscent old age as the distinguished mistress of the powerful patron of her dreams. We discover that a geisha is more analogous to a Western "trophy wife" than to a prostitute--and, as in Austen, flat-out prostitution and early death is a woman's alternative to the repressive, arcane system of courtship. In simple, elegant prose, Golden puts us right in the tearoom with the geisha; we are there as she gracefully fights for her life in a social situation where careers are made or destroyed by a witticism, a too-revealing (or not revealing enough) glimpse of flesh under the kimono, or a vicious rumor spread by a rival "as cruel as a spider." </p><p> Golden's web is finely woven, but his book has a serious flaw: the geisha's true romance rings hollow--the love of her life is a symbol, not a character. Her villainous geisha nemesis is sharply drawn, but she would be more so if we got a deeper peek into the cause of her motiveless malignity--the plight all geisha share. Still, Golden has won the triple crown of fiction: he has created a plausible female protagonist in a vivid, now-vanished world, and he gloriously captures Japanese culture by expressing his thoughts in authentic Eastern metaphors.</p>"Wonderful, involving, intelligent, fascinating, and almost Dickensian in the way the characters inhabit the landscape, and the landscape permeates the characters. It's a unique, beautifully written book."<br>--Ann Beattie<br><br>"I still can't quite believe that an American male can so seamlessly enter the soul of a Japanese woman, and catch her world, its textures, its hopes, and its sinuous patter with such perfection. Memoirs of a Geisha evokes all the delicate steel of Kyoto's geisha culture with such uncanny fidelity that, after you've finished, you feel as if you've entered not just another world, but an extraordinary and foreign heart."<br>--Pico Iyer<br><br>"Sayuri tells her story with such gentle courtesy and determination that you are quickly brought under the spell of her character. She takes you by the hand and leads you into a world that is both formal and intimate, a world that I had only before glimpsed in the fleeting and beautiful images of traditional Japanese ink painting...Memoirs of a Geisha is a wonderful achievement."<br>--Julia Blackburn<br><br>"A haunting tale of a hidden world that could hold an audience spellbound through many an evening in a lantern-lit teahouse."<br>--Geraldine Brooks<br><br>"Memoirs of a Geisha is a masterpiece.

With prefaces by the mostly male authors (five contributors are women), the pieces are a generally absorbing and provocative skim of liberal American cultural and political interests; their impact, however, has been blunted through abridgement and some don't pass the test of time (particularly stale are Robin Green's story of the marketing of teen idol David Cassidy and David Black's expose on AIDS). Further selections include Robert Greenfield touring with the Rolling Stones in 1971, Hunter Thompson practicing "Gonzo" journalism, Tom Wolfe probing the psychology of astronauts, Marcelle Clements telling us why she and her friends no longer smoke pot and David Harris interviewing Ron Kovic, a paralyzed former marine who became an anti-war activist. In other essays, Joe Eszterhas tracks daredevil Evel Knievel, Howard Kohn links Karen Silkwood's death to a corrupt nuclear plant, Howard Kohn and David Weir get the inside scoop on fugitive Patty Hearst, Greil Marcus grieves for Elvis, Randall Sullivan shows how a cheerleader's murder by a less popular classmate is symptomatic of the greed-driven eighties, Tim Cahill hikes across Death Valley and P.J.

It might seem a straightforward question, but there is no consensus among modern communities of the Qur&#x2019;an, both Muslim and non-Muslim, about the answer. And why should there be?<br> <br>On numerous occasions throughout history, believers from different schools and denominations, and at different times and places, have agreed to disagree. The Qur&#x2019;anic interpreters, jurists and theologians of medieval Baghdad, Cairo and Cordoba coexisted peacefully in spite of their diverging beliefs. Seeking to revive this &#x2018;ethics of disagreement&#x2019; of Classical Islam, this volume explores the different relationships societies around the world have with the Qur&#x2019;an and how our understanding of the text can be shaped by studying the interpretations of others. From LGBT groups to urban African American communities, this book aims to represent the true diversity of communities of the Qur&#x2019;an in the twenty-first century, and the dialogue and debate that can flow among them.</p><p><b>Emran El-Badawi</b> is Associate Professor and Director of the Middle Eastern Studies Program at the University of Houston.<br> <br> <b>Paula Sanders</b> is Professor of History and Director of the Boniuk Institute for Religious Tolerance at Rice University in Houston, Texas.&#x2018;This lovely collection describes ten different interpretive communities, both Muslim and non-Muslim, of the Qur&#x2019;an.

The Aquinas Prescription opens the door for you to a richer and more fully integrated spiritual and intellectual life than you&#x2019;ve ever experienced &#x2014; through the much-misunderstood thought and example of St. Thomas Aquinas. According to author Gerald Vann, only the wisdom of St. Thomas can heal the spiritual agony and barrenness of our broken modern age. Vann, the wise Dominican priest who wrote The Devil and How to Resist Him, maintains that even the most faithful Christians today can&#x2019;t help but be tainted by the materialism, self-obsession, and plain rottenness of the surrounding culture. But The Aquinas Prescription offers you a way out. In chapters that include a brief, loving biography of Aquinas and explanations of how his thinking relates to the currents of his day and ours, Vann shows that if you want to know the answer to the riddle of life, if you want to achieve wisdom, if you want to be fully alive, you must learn from Aquinas how to unite the broken shards of modern life: rationalism and spirituality, action and mysticism. You need to follow the real teaching and personal example of St. Thomas in its balanced and integrated fullness. With the guidance of The Aquinas Prescription, you&#x2019;ll be able more richly than ever to give glory to the Light that he so ably and lovingly illuminated. Among the surprising and useful insights of The Aquinas Prescription: contemplation and action: the little-known way St. Thomas united them &#x2014; and you can, too; St. Thomas&#x2019;s thought: is it dated? How he made sure that it never would be; law and grace: how St. Thomas unites them but the modern world divides them &#x2014; to its peril; St. Thomas&#x2019;s dynamic view of knowledge: not as a disconnected intellectual exercise, but as a form of life and of becoming more alive; the failure of Thomism: how St. Thomas&#x2019;s great syntheses were lost among his followers; why the great medieval cities were revered for their citadels of study &#x2014; while today&#x2019;s cities are admired for the skyscrapers of hard commerce; the sure way (not the easy way) to happiness and joy: how St. Thomas blazed the trail; what the Roman Church can learn from the Eastern Churches (something St. Thomas knew!); how St. Thomas, with all-embracing faith, used reason to elucidate revelation; mysticism: how St. Thomas beautifully reveals that its true roots lie in a rational investigation of the things of faith; how St. Thomas&#x2019;s lack of personal vanity impressed even his bitterest opponents; scholastic philosophy: how St. Thomas streamlined, simplified, and rejuvenated it, making it a more useful tool to find the truth; plus much more that will give you Aquinas&#x2019;s key to healing the anguish of modern society!</p><p>Fr. Gerald Vann (1906-1963), an English Dominican, spent his life preaching the gospel. His works manifest a profound compassion for souls struggling to know God and serve Him truly.

He recommends leaving the rigid techniques and painful positions to celibate yogis and long-faced monks and instead promotes a more Western approach. </p><p> "Lorin Roche, probably the friendliest meditation teacher in America, has written a gentle, supportive book that makes it clear as crystal why meditation is healing." --James Fadiman, Ph.D., author of <i>Unlimit Your Life</i> </p><p> "<i>Whole Body Meditations</i> is filled with practical and creative wisdom.

The evolution of our favorite horror icons mirrors the great social crises of our times. Author David Skal shows how Cold War paranoia, nuclear fears, and now AIDS led to films such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Fly, Dracula and other horror hits.</p><p>This study of the visual horror genre from Dr. Caligari to Dr. Hannibal Lecter starts with a discussion of Diane Arbus's photographs of freaks. David Skal then suggests that he will seek to "explain why the images resonated in the culture ... [and] why so much of our imaginative life in the 20th century has been devoted to peeling back the masks and scabs of civilization, to finding, cultivating, and projecting nightmare images of the secret self." Whether or not you agree with his thesis that horror is a symptom of society's ills (war, disease, poverty), you will find much of value in this thorough, highly readable history--especially the detailed accounts of the work of filmmaker Tod Browning, and of how <i>Frankenstein</i> and <i>Dracula</i> made their way from books to plays to films. The book is handsomely designed (hardcover has dust jacket by Edward Gorey), with illustrations, footnotes, and index.<b>David J.

But a medical revolution is underway that can solve this problem: Astonishing new research is revealing that the health of your brain is, to an extraordinary degree, dictated by the state of your microbiome - the vast population of organisms that live in your body and outnumber your own cells ten to one. What's taking place in your intestines today is determining your risk for any number of brain-related conditions.<br><br> In BRAIN MAKER, Dr. Perlmutter explains the potent interplay between intestinal microbes and the brain, describing how the microbiome develops from birth and evolves based on lifestyle choices, how it can become "sick," and how nurturing gut health through a few easy strategies can alter your brain's destiny for the better. With simple dietary recommendations and a highly practical program of six steps to improving gut ecology, BRAIN MAKER opens the door to unprecedented brain health potential.</p><p><b>David Perlmutter, MD</b>, is a globally recognized leader in brain science.

The first of these, Village School, was published in 1955, and Miss Read continued to write until her retirement in 1996. In the 1998, she was awarded an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for her services to literature. She lives in Berkshire.Working together since 1955, "Miss Read" (Doris Saint) and artist Goodall have created 31 books about a village in the English Cotswolds. Thrush Green is imaginary, inspired by the author's years in just such a place, among good friends. We find the source of the stories in photos here showing the real village of Wood Green and recognizable prototypes of Miss Read's characters. Additionally, Goodall's nostalgic, colorful paintings vivify the country settings: tranquil fields of flowers, a fairground ablaze with light and excitement and other views that fix the locales in memory. The artist's skilled portraits depict the aptly named "Dotty," eccentric spinster; lazy Albert Piggott; the rich but miserly old Misses Lovelock and others more admirable but not impossibly perfect. All are dear to readers who have met them in Miss Read's sometimes funny, often poignant, always absorbing chronicles. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Confessions of St. Augustine</h2><p>St. Augustine was one of the most remarkable figures of the early Church. In his famous classic,&nbsp;<i>Confessions</i>, Augustine reveals his struggles with temptation as well as his passionate love of God. This work has extracts chosen from his&nbsp;<i>Confessions</i>&nbsp;that express Augustine's wisdom and his mystical yearning for God, as well as his dissolute youth, his ascent to the imperial court in Milan, and his conversion to Christianity at the age of 32.<br> Lively narrative and colorful anecdotes are interspersed with passages of great poetry in praise of God. In the process of describing his own very human failings, Augustine also gives advice on how to live a committed Christian life. His view that happiness is not to be found in transitory physical pleasure, but in searching for the truth beyond the material world, is more than ever relevant today.<br> In this first modern illustrated edition of the&nbsp;<i>Confessions</i>, St. Augustine's words are accompanied by beautiful medieval and Renaissance illustrations from manuscripts in the collection from the British Library.</p><p></p><h2>Civics for Today: Participation and Citizenship</h2><p>In excellent condition, no highlights or marks.</p><p></p><h2>Split Infinity (Apprentice Adept, Bk. 1)</h2><p>On the technological, decadent world of Proton, someone was trying to destroy Stile, serf and master Gamesman.

Rick Riordan lives with his family in San Antonio, Texas.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br>We got married in a thunderstorm. That should&#x2019;ve been my first warning. <br><br>The Southwest Craft Center courtyard was festooned with white crepe paper. The tables were laden with fresh tamales, chips and salsa. Cases of Shiner Bock sweated on ice in tin buckets. The margarita machine was humming. The San Antonio River flowed past the old limestone walls. <br><br>Maia looked beautiful in her cream bridal dress. Her black hair was curled in ringlets and her coppery skin glowed with health. <br><br>The guests had arrived: my mother, fresh from a tour of Guatemala; my brother, Garrett, not-so-fresh from our long bachelor party in Austin; and a hundred other relatives, cops, thugs, ex-cons, lawyers&#x2014;all the people who had made my life so interesting the past few decades. <br><br>Then the clouds came. Lightning sparked off a mesquite tree. The sky opened up, and our outdoor wedding became a footrace to the chapel with the retired Baptist minister and the Buddhist monk leading the pack. <br><br>Larry Cho, the monk, had a commanding early lead, but Reverend Buckner Fanning held steady around the tamale table while Larry the Buddhist had to swerve to avoid a beer keg and got blocked out by a couple of bail bondsmen. Buckner was long retired, but he sure stayed fit. He won the race to the chapel and held the door for the others as we came pouring in. <br><br>I was last, helping Maia, since she couldn&#x2019;t move very quickly. Partly that was because of the wedding dress. Mostly it was because she was eight and a half months pregnant. I held a plastic bag over our heads as we plodded through the rain. <br><br>&#x201c;This was not in the forecast,&#x201d; she protested. <br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I agreed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking God owes us a refund.&#x201d; <br><br>Inside, the chapel was dark and smelled of musty limestone. The cedar floorboards creaked under our feet. The crowd milled around, watching out the windows as our party decorations were barraged into mush. Rain drummed off the grass so hard it made a layer of haze three feet high. The crepe paper melted and watery salsa overflowed off the edge of the tables. <br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Buckner said, beaming as if God had made this glorious moment just for us. &#x201c;We still have a holy matrimony to perform.&#x201d; <br><br>Actually, I was raised Catholic, which is why the wedding was half-Buddhist, half-Baptist. Maia had not been a practicing Buddhist since she was a little girl in China, but she liked Larry the Buddhist, and the incense and beads made her feel nostalgic. <br><br>Buckner Fanning was the most respected Baptist minister in San Antonio. He also knew my mom from way back. When the Catholic priest had been reluctant to perform the ceremony (something about Maia being pregnant out of wedlock; go figure), my mom had recruited Buckner. <br><br>For his part, Buckner had talked to me in advance about doing the right thing by getting married, how he hoped we would raise our child to know God. I told him we hadn&#x2019;t actually talked to God about the matter yet, but we were playing phone tag. Buckner, fortunately, had a sense of humor. He agreed to marry us. <br><br>We were a pretty bedraggled crew when we reassembled in the old chapel. Rain poured down the stained-glass windows and hammered on the roof. I glanced over at Ana DeLeon, our homicide detective friend, who was toweling off her daughter Lucia&#x2019;s hair. Ana smiled at me. I gave her a wink, but it was painful to hold her eyes too long. It was hard not to think about her husband, who should have been standing at her side. <br><br>Larry the Buddhist rang his gong and lit some incense. He chanted a sutra. Then Buckner began talking about the marriage covenant. <br><br>My eyes met Maia&#x2019;s. She was studying me quizzically. Maybe she was wondering why she&#x2019;d agreed to hook up with a guy like me. Then she smiled, and I remembered how we&#x2019;d met in a bar in Berkeley fifteen years ago. Every time she smiled like that, she sent an electric charge straight down my back. <br><br>I&#x2019;m afraid I missed most of what Buckner had to say. But I heard the &#x201c;I do&#x201d; part. I said the vow without hesitation. <br><br>Afterward, we waded through the well-wishers: my old&nbsp; girlfriend, Lillian Cambridge; Madeleine White, the mafia princess; Larry Drapiewski, the retired deputy; Milo Chavez, the music agent from Nashville; Messieurs Terrence and Goldman, Maia&#x2019;s old bosses from the law firm in San Francisco; my mom and her newest boyfriend, a millionaire named Jack Mariner. All sorts of dangerous rain-soaked people. <br><br>We ate soggy wedding cake and drank champagne and waited for the storm to pass. As Maia talked with some of her former colleagues, Garrett cornered me at the bar. <br><br>My brother was wearing what passed for wedding garb: a worn tuxedo jacket over his tie-dyed T-shirt. His scraggly beard and poorly combed hair looked like a wheat field after a hailstorm. His tuxedo pants were pinned up (since he didn&#x2019;t have legs) and he&#x2019;d woven carnations through the spokes of his wheelchair. <br><br>&#x201c;Grats, little bro.&#x201d; He lifted his plate of tamales in salute. &#x201c;Good eats.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You congratulating me on the tamales or the marriage?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Depends.&#x201d; He belched into his fist, which was for him pretty darned discreet. &#x201c;What you got planned for the honeymoon?&#x201d; <br><br>Right then, my internal alarms should&#x2019;ve been ringing. I should&#x2019;ve backed away, told him to get another plate of tamales and saved myself a lot of trouble. Instead, I said, <br><br>&#x201c;Nothing, really. Maia&#x2019;s pregnant, you may have noticed.&#x201d; Garrett waved his hand dismissively. <br><br>&#x201c;Doing nothing for your honeymoon don&#x2019;t cut it, little bro. Listen, I got a proposition.&#x201d; <br><br>Maybe it was the joyous occasion, or the fact that I was&nbsp; surrounded by friends. Maybe it was just the fact that it was raining too hard to leave. But I was in the mood to think well of my brother. <br><br>I would have plenty of time to regret that later. But that afternoon, with the rain coming down, I listened as Garrett told me his idea.&nbsp;</p><h2>Principles of Management Version 4.0</h2><p>If purchased from FlatWorld, the publisher, this version includes Online Access, Homework and a Print copy via a redeemable code shipped with the print book.

Photographs throughout of Minik give a glimpse into the incredible differences between the multiple worlds he inhabited, and how impossible it must have been to live in these worlds successfully. The title derives from one of Minik's more harrowing experiences--finding his father's bones displayed in a natural-history museum as a "curiosity"--and his attempts to retrieve the bones for a more respectful burial. Author Kenn Harper, while including many facts and articles about Arctic exploration, refrains from sharing opinions about the various explorers or their methods, choosing to share this story--and his years of research--plainly. From the death of Minik's birth father to the financial ruin of his American foster family, the events of Minik's childhood seem like one disaster after another, and his adulthood--the successful return to Greenland, followed by disappointment and a subsequent return to New York--is an unhappy struggle to find some kind of personal fulfillment. Questions of racial and cultural differences make an inescapable larger framework for Minik's life, and the emotions brought forward in answering those questions make reading this book a powerful experience. <i>--Jill Lightner</i>For more than thirty years, <b>Kenn Harper</b> has lived in Eskimo communities in the Baffin Region and in Qaanaaq, Greenland.

More than one hundred animals and plants that were first carefully described and in some cases discovered by Lewis and Clark are identified here.&nbsp;More than accounts of the regional flora and fauna, <i>Lewis and Clark on the Great Plains</i> examines the lasting importance of the expedition&#x2019;s discoveries, the significance of the Plains plants and animals to local Native Americans, and the current status of Plains wildlife. Lavishly illustrated with Paul A. Johnsgard&#x2019;s drawings of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and plants, the book also includes a guide to the Lewis and Clark sites of botanical and zoological interest and more than seventy sites where readers can follow in the footsteps of two of America&#x2019;s greatest pioneering naturalists.</p><p>Paul A.

But this community once had an impact on American history that rivaled the far larger black worlds of Harlem and Chicago. It published the most widely read black newspaper in the country, urging black voters to switch from the Republican to the Democratic Party and then rallying black support for World War II. It fielded two of the greatest baseball teams of the Negro Leagues and introduced Jackie Robinson to the Brooklyn Dodgers. Pittsburgh was the childhood home of jazz pioneers Billy Strayhorn, Billy Eckstine, Earl Hines, Mary Lou Williams, and Erroll Garner; Hall of Fame slugger Josh Gibson&#x2014;and August Wilson himself. Some of the most glittering figures of the era were changed forever by the time they spent in the city, from Joe Louis and Satchel Paige to Duke Ellington and Lena Horne.<br> <br>Mark Whitaker&#x2019;s <i>Smoketown</i> is a captivating portrait of this unsung community and a vital addition to the story of black America. It depicts how ambitious Southern migrants were drawn to a steel-making city on a strategic river junction; how they were shaped by its schools and a spirit of commerce with roots in the Gilded Age; and how their world was eventually destroyed by industrial decline and urban renewal.

With the diligence of a seasoned anthropologist, Whitaker spotlights the city&#x2019;s stunning feats of black achievement and resilience through the lens of his extensive cast of influencers and icons. While some of the names may be unfamiliar, each subject&#x2019;s narrative is a nuanced portrayal meant to challenge our country&#x2019;s often narrow, dismissive version of black history. Cultural heavyweights such as boxer Joe Louis are treated as historical catalysts rather than extraordinary oddities. Black history, as evident in the cultural renaissance of Pittsburgh, is not defined by oppression.

As governments learned to invest tax revenue in the long-term financial resources of the market, they vastly increased their administrative power and gained the ability to use fiscal, monetary, and financial policy to manage their economies. But why did the modern fiscal state emerge in some places and not in others? In approaching this question, Wenkai He compares the paths of three different nations&#x2015;England, Japan, and China&#x2015;to discover why some governments developed the tools and institutions of modern public finance, while others, facing similar circumstances, failed to do so.</p><p>Focusing on three key periods of institutional development&#x2015;the decades after the English Civil Wars, the Meiji Restoration, and the Taiping Rebellion&#x2015;He demonstrates how each event precipitated a collapse of the existing institutions of public finance. Facing urgent calls for revenue, each government searched for new ways to make up the shortfall. These experiments took varied forms, from new methods of taxation to new credit arrangements. Yet, while England and Japan learned from their successes and failures how to deploy the tools of modern public finance and equipped themselves to become world powers, China did not. He&#x2019;s comparative historical analysis isolates the nature of the credit crisis confronting each state as the crucial factor in determining its specific trajectory. This perceptive and persuasive explanation for China&#x2019;s failure at a critical moment in its history illuminates one of the most important but least understood transformations of the modern world.</p></p><p>Wenkai He is Assistant Professor in the Division of Social Science at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.&#x201c;A genuinely important piece of scholarship that has the potential to become a benchmark in the literature. The author combines new institutionalism, comparative historical sociology, and first-rate historical scholarship to make a novel and compelling explanation for the rise of the modern fiscal state. This book will be of particular interest today, given its relevance to the debt and credit crises that so many countries in the developed world are currently experiencing.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Daniel Little, University of Michigan&#x2013;Dearborn</b><br><br>&#x201c;An outstanding work that takes on a classic subject in a new way.

And Caliban, the strange and feral boy Prospero has bewitched to serve him. The two find solace and companionship in each other as Prospero weaves his magic and dreams of revenge. </p><p>Always under Prospero&#x2019;s jealous eye, Miranda and Caliban battle the dark, unknowable forces that bind them to the island even as the pangs of adolescence create a new awareness of each other and their doomed relationship.</p></p><p>Jacqueline Carey is the author of the New York Times bestselling Kushiel's Legacy series, beginning with <i>Kushiel's Dart, Kushiel's Chosen </i>and <i>Kushiel's Avatar</i>, The Sundering epic fantasy duology, postmodern fables "Santa Olivia" and "Saints Astray," and the Agent of Hel contemporary fantasy series. Carey lives in west Michigan.The events of Shakespeare's The Tempest serve as the climax to a coming-of-age story that imagines Miranda's lonely life growing up on an island and the deep friendship between her and the wild child Caliban. Miranda's father, Prospero, relies on magic to punish and bind, while the sprite Ariel uses cruel words. Miranda and Caliban find kindness in each other as they discover more about the world around them, but even they cannot thwart Prospero's larger plans. In Carey's hands, Shakespeare's characters take on new dimensions, and his happy ending turns devastating. Very short chapters propel the story forward, and perspectives alternate between Miranda and Caliban, both of whom have unique voices that deepen as they age and begin to rebel. While teens will know more than the protagonists, they will empathize with their confusion and innocence and bristle when Ariel uses Miranda's and Caliban's lack of knowledge against them. Familiarity with the source material will foreshadow the conclusion, but even those who haven't read The Tempest will feel the lingering pain of the characters long after putting down the book. VERDICT While it fully stands on its own, this beautiful and heartbreaking tale adds new depth and perspective to a timeless Shakespearean work&#x2014;perfect for fans of the classics.&#x2014;Jennifer Rothschild, Arlington Public Library, VA</p><h2>The Elements of Visualization</h2><p>A valuable introduction in explaining the basic processes of utilizing the mind&#39;s imagination.</p><p></p><h2>The Execution of Mayor Yin and Other Stories from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Revised Edition</h2><p><p>Praise for the first edition:</p><p>... in the great tradition of Orwell and Solzhenitsyn; its true subject is the survival&#x2015;and sometimes the defeat&#x2015;of the human spirit in its lonely quest for integrity." &#x2015;Time</p><p>The almost childlike directness of Chen's tales... is captured in the very lightly revised translations of this new edition...

One of the most prolific and talented photographers of this extreme sport is Jeff Curtes. CHASING EPIC: THE SNOWBOARD PHOTOGRAPHS OF JEFF CURTES is not only the ultimate document of snowboarding but an impressive artistic achievement as well. Curtes&#x2019;s camera juxtaposes the best snowboarders of our time, including Shaun White and many others, across impossibly beautiful, majestic, and insane mountainsides. His compositions emphasize the lone individual soaring across awe-inspiring landscapes in an almost surreal and sometimes abstract figure/ground/sky relationship.

In 1994, Curtes signed with Burton Snowboards and had been their principal photographer until 2012, nearly 20 years behind the lens on the snow. Jeff&#x2019;s work with Burton, originating with action-centric images, was unique in that it came from within the core snowboarder&#x2019;s lifestyle. He was living and breathing snowboarding with his brother, Joe Curtes, as they traveled from the Midwest to the Mountains of the West Coast. Burton allowed Curtes to travel the world in search of the epic conditions that every snowboarder dreams of, and, in return, Curtes&#x2019;s camera delivered an overwhelming collection of photographs to their light table.These images not only made incredible advertising and catalog content but also defined a subculture and captured the early history of snowboarding like no others before.</p><p>Jeff Curtes (b. 1969) has been at the forefront of the snowboarding industry&#x2019;s imagery since his first published images back in 1992.

He lives in Virginia.James Bond saves the world from criminal genius, Take 13 (Take 27, if you count Ian Fleming's original series): an unapologetic nostalgia piece by Fleming's sturdy successor. When the mandarins of Her Majesty's spanking new agency MicroGlobe One need somebody to goad cruise-line king Sir Max Tarn, fingered by his own accountant as a high-end arms dealer, into cutting and running so they can pull him in without giving away the accountant, the obvious choice is James Bond, who's just celebrated his promotion to Director of the Double Zero troubleshooting branch by foiling a hijacking on Sir Max's own ship. In go Bond and his inamorata Fredericka von Gr sse (Never Send Flowers, 1993), and out pop Sir Max and his wife--apparently right into a fatal auto accident. It's up to Bond, who actually saw Tarn pulling away from Hall's Manor hours after the supposed crash, to get the goods on the late Sir Max--a labor of hate that takes him from London to Seville to Jerusalem (for an unusually gratuitous episode with Tarn's wife) to Tarn's family estate of Wasserburg in Germany (where you'll never guess what Bond learns about Tarn's political affiliations) to San Juan, where Tarn's nefarious master plan finally becomes clear hours before a cheerfully noisy holocaust. As he dodges threats of ``fast, sudden death'' from ``the most evil man I have ever known'' (the testimonial of a Tarn confederate), Bond finds that his romantic relationship ``had begun to give him something that had never been present with any previous woman''-- not a good sign for anybody who remembers the fate of Tracy di Vicenzo. A feast of the predictable--from counterterrorist high-tech to the return of Felix Leiter--that's probably the best Bond since Win, Lose, or Die (1989). If you can swallow Pierce Brosnan as 007, you won't have any trouble getting this down. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Does language reflect the culture of a society? Is our mother-tongue a lens through which we perceive the world? Can different languages lead their speakers to different thoughts? In &#34;Through the Language Glass&#34;, acclaimed author Guy Deutscher will convince you that, contrary to the fashionable academic consensus of today, the answer to all these questions is - yes. On an odyssey that takes us from Homer to Darwin, from scientists to savages, from the corridors of Yale to the rivers of the Amazon, from how to name the rainbow to why Russian water - a &#39;she&#39; - become a &#39;he&#39; once you have dipped a tea bag into her, this book explores some of the most fascinating and controversial questions about language, culture and the human mind.</p><p>Guy Deutscher is the author of The Unfolding of Language: The Evolution of Mankind&#39;s Greatest Invention. Formerly a Fellow of St John&#39;s College, Cambridge, and of the Department of Ancient Near Eastern Languages in the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, he is an honorary Research Fellow at the School of Languages, Linguistics and Cultures in the University of Manchester. Through the Language Glass is his third book. He lives in Oxford with his wife and two daughters.<p>PROLOGUE </p><p>Language, Culture, and Thought </p><p>"There are four tongues worthy of the world's use," says the Talmud: "Greek for song, Latin for war, Syriac for lamentation, and Hebrew for ordinary speech." Other authorities have been no less decided in their judgment on what different languages are good for. The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, king of Spain, archduke of Austria, and master of several Europe an tongues, professed to speaking "Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse." </p><p>A nation's language, so we are often told, reflects its culture, psyche, and modes of thought. Peoples in tropical climes are so laid-back it's no wonder they let most of their consonants fall by the wayside. And one need only compare the mellow sounds of Portuguese with the harshness of Spanish to understand the quintessential difference between these two neighboring cultures. The grammar of some languages is simply not logical enough to express complex ideas. German, on the other hand, is an ideal vehicle for formulating the most precise philosophical profundities, as it is a particularly orderly language, which is why the Germans have such orderly minds. (But can one not hear the goose step in its gauche, humorless sounds?) Some languages don't even have a future tense, so their speakers naturally have no grasp of the future. The Babylonians would have been hard-pressed to understand <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, because their language used one and the same word to describe both of these concepts. The craggy fjords are audible in the precipitous intonation of Norwegian, and you can hear the dark <i>l</i>'s of Russian in Tchaikovsky's lugubrious tunes. French is not only a Romance language but the language of romance par excellence. English is an adaptable, even promiscuous language, and Italian&#x2014;ah, Italian! </p><p>Many a dinner table conversation is embellished by such vignettes, for few subjects lend themselves more readily to disquisition than the character of different languages and their speakers. And yet should these lofty observations be carried away from the conviviality of the dining room to the chill of the study, they would quickly collapse like a souffl� of airy anecdote&#x2014; at best amusing and meaningless, at worst bigoted and absurd. Most foreigners cannot hear the difference between rugged Norwegian and the endless plains of Swedish. The industrious Protestant Danes have dropped more consonants onto their icy windswept soil than any indolent tropical tribe. And if Germans do have systematic minds, this is just as likely to be because their exceedingly erratic mother tongue has exhausted their brains' capacity to cope with any further irregularity. English speakers can hold lengthy conversations about forthcoming events wholly in the present tense (I'm flying to Vancouver next week . . . ) without any detectable loosening in their grip on the concepts of futurity. No language&#x2014;not even that of the most "primitive" tribes&#x2014;is inherently unsuitable for expressing the most complex ideas. Any shortcomings in a language's ability to philosophize simply boil down to the lack of some specialized abstract vocabulary and perhaps a few syntactic constructions, but these can easily be borrowed, just as all Europe an languages pinched their verbal philosophical tool kit from Latin, which in turn lifted it wholesale from Greek. If speakers of any tribal tongue were so minded, they could easily do the same today, and it would be eminently possible to deliberate in Zulu about the respective merits of empiricism and rationalism or to hold forth about existentialist phenomenology in West Greenlandic. </p><p>If musings on nations and languages were merely aired over aperitifs, they could be indulged as harmless, if nonsensical, diversions. But as it happens, the subject has also exercised high and learned minds throughout the ages. Philosophers of all persuasions and nationalities have lined up to proclaim that each language reflects the qualities of the nation that speaks it. In the seventeenth century, the Englishman Francis Bacon explained that one can infer "significant marks of the genius and manners of people and nations from their languages." "Everything confirms," agreed the Frenchman �tienne de Condillac a century later, "that each language expresses the character of the people who speak it." His younger contemporary, the German Johann Gottfried Herder, concurred that "the intellect and the character of every nation are stamped in its language." Industrious nations, he said, "have an abundance of moods in their verbs, while more refined nations have a large amount of nouns that have been exalted to abstract notions." In short, "the genius of a nation is nowhere better revealed than in the physiognomy of its speech." The American Ralph Waldo Emerson summed it all up in 1844: "We infer the spirit of the nation in great measure from the language, which is a sort of monument to which each forcible individual in a course of many hundred years has contributed a stone." </p><p>The only problem with this impressive international unanimity is that it breaks down as soon as thinkers move on from the general principles to reflect on the particular qualities (or otherwise) of particular languages, and about what these linguistic qualities can tell about the qualities (or otherwise) of particular nations. In 1889, Emerson's words were assigned as an essay topic to the seventeen-year-old Bertrand Russell, when he was at a crammer in London preparing for the scholarship entrance exam to Trinity College, Cambridge. Russell responded with these pearls: "We may study the character of a people by the ideas which its language best expresses. French, for instance, contains such words as 'spirituel,' or 'l'esprit,' which in English can scarcely be expressed at all; whence we naturally draw the inference, which may be confirmed by actual observation, that the French have more 'esprit,' and are more 'spirituel' than the English." </p><p>Cicero, on the other hand, drew exactly the opposite inference from the lack of a word in a language. In his <i>De oratore</i> of 55 bc, he embarked on a lengthy sermon about the lack of a Greek equivalent for the Latin word <i>ineptus</i> (meaning "impertinent" or "tactless"). Russell would have concluded that the Greeks had such impeccable manners that they simply did not need a word to describe a nonexistent flaw. Not so Cicero: for him, the absence of the word was a proof that the fault was so widespread among the Greeks that they didn't even notice it. </p><p>The language of the Romans was itself not always immune to censure. Some twelve centuries after Cicero, Dante Alighieri surveyed the dialects of Italy in his <i>De vulgari eloquentia</i> and declared that "what the&nbsp;Romans speak is not so much a vernacular as a vile jargon . . . and this should come as no surprise, for they also stand out among all Italians for the ugliness of their manners and their outward appearance." </p><p>No one would dream of entertaining such sentiments about the French language, which is not only romantic and <i>spirituel</i> but also, of course, the paragon of logic and clarity. We have this on no lesser authority than the French themselves. In 1894, the distinguished critic Ferdinand Bruneti�re informed the members of the Acad�mie fran�aise, on the occasion of his election to this illustrious institution, that French was "the most logical, the clearest, and the most transparent language that has ever been spoken by man." Bruneti�re, in turn, had this on the authority of a long line of savants, including Voltaire in the eighteenth century, who affirmed that the unique genius of the French language was its clearness and order. And Voltaire himself owed this insight to an astonishing discovery made a whole century earlier, in 1669, to be precise. The French grammarians of the seventeenth century had spent decades trying to understand why it was that French possessed clarity beyond all other languages in the world and why, as one member of the Acad�mie put it, French was endowed with such clarity and precision that simply translating into it had the effect of a real commentary. In the end, after years of travail, it was Louis Le Laboureur who discovered in 1669 that the answer was simplicity itself. His painstaking grammatical researches revealed that, in contrast to speakers of other languages, "we French follow in all our utterances exactly the order of thought, which is the order of Nature." No wonder, then, that French can never be obscure. As the later thinker Antoine de Rivarol put it: "What is not clear may be English, Italian, Greek, or Latin" but "ce qui n'est pas clair n'est pas fran�ais." </p><p>Not all intellectuals of the world unite, however, in concurring with this analysis. Equally distinguished thinkers&#x2014; strangely enough, mostly from outside France&#x2014;have expressed different opinions. The renowned Danish linguist Otto Jespersen, for example, believed that English was superior to French in a whole range of attributes, including logic, for as opposed to French, English is a "methodical, energetic, business-like and sober language, that does not care much for finery and elegance, but does care for logical consistency." Jespersen concludes: "As the language is, so also is the nation." </p></p><h2>The Making of American Liberal Theology: Crisis, Irony, and Postmodernity, 1950-2005</h2><p><p>In this concluding volume of his magisterial trilogy, Gary Dorrien sustains his previous definition of liberal theology and his mixture of theological, philosophical, and historical analysis, while emphasizing the unprecedented diversity of liberal theology in the postmodern age. Dorrien argues that liberal theology has been in crisis for the past half-century, yet despite the crisis, and also because of it, it has also experienced a "hidden renaissance" of intellectual creativity. Liberal theology in the early twenty-first century is more diverse, complex, and marginalized than ever before in its history, he concludes, but its essential idea--creating a progressive, credible, integrative third way between orthodox over-belief and secular unbelief--remains as necessary as ever.</p></p><p><b>Gary Dorrien</b> is Reinhold Niebuhr Professor of Social Ethics at Union Theological Seminary and Professor of Religion at Columbia University in New York City.

Richard Tithecott suggests that the stories we tell and the images we conjure of serial killers&#x2014;real and fictional&#x2014;reveal as much about mainstream culture and its values, desires, and anxieties as they do about the killers themselves.</p></p><p>"This is a book, not about what makes the serial killer tick, but about those of us--all of us--who have wound the clock and need to keep it running." These words by historian James Kincaid, in the foreword to <i>Of Men and Monsters</i>, introduce the idea, explored in depth by author Richard Tithecott, that we construct the phenomenon of serial killing. We also construct ourselves, he says, as audience to that spectacle. The killer himself responds to that audience, in a classic loop of the observer affecting the observed. It is a postmodern view, of course, to say that society, and its designated representatives such as FBI serial-killer experts, actually collude in the actions of a "monster" like Jeffrey Dahmer. Tithecott draws on the ideas of French philosopher Michel Foucault to explain and illustrate this view, using prose that is heavy going in places, but still quite readable. <p> Another important contribution to the cultural study of violence is Mark Seltzer's <i>Serial Killers: Death and Life in America's Wound Culture</i>.</p>Richard Tithecott is an administrative director at the University of Southern California.

But what does it mean if the company achieves its goals but the value of its stock declines at the same time? According to Rappaport, these companies are judging success by the wrong standards, and often become the target for takeovers. Rappaport argues that the ultimate test of corporate strategy, indeed the only reliable measure, is whether it creates economic value for shareholders.</p><p>Should a company's management be most accountable to employees, customers, or management itself? In <i>Creating Shareholder Value</i>, Alfred Rappaport argues that management's primary responsibility is to company shareholders. First published 12 years ago, the ideas put forth by Rappaport have since become commonplace in companies around the world. <p> Rappaport eschews the most common measures of a company's performance, such as price-to-earnings ratios ("Cash is a fact, profit is an opinion"), return on investment, and equity measures, instead concentrating on developing a shareholder value approach that measures "value drivers" such as sales-growth rates, operating profit margins, and cost of capital. This revised and updated edition addresses the issues of corporate downsizing and the social responsibilities of business. It also includes new sections on the value of mergers and acquisitions and how to implement a shareholder value system.

Having succeeded in that epic venture, they faced the prospect of moving beyond the beaches of France.For the Germans who had failed to halt the Allies at the water's edge, the question was how to stop the enemy from further advance before it was too late.Martin Blumenson never forgets that the Allies' spectacular dash from their Normandy beachhead to the German border in the summer of 1944 was accomplished by men of flesh and blood&#x2014;and led by officers with human doubts, limitations, and determination. He shows us how war is conducted, makes us share the pressures and responsibilities of the commanders, and unforgettably opens us to the hopes and fears of the men who constantly faced the imminence of death.

The "intolerant zeal" of Christians, wrote Edward Gibbon, swept Rome's old gods away, and with them the structures that sustained Roman society. </p><p> Not so, argues Douglas Boin. Such tales are simply untrue to history, and ignore the most important fact of all: life in Rome never came to a dramatic stop. Instead, as Boin shows, a small minority movement rose to transform society--politically, religiously, and culturally--but it was a gradual process, one that happened in fits and starts over centuries. Drawing upon a decade of recent studies in history and archaeology, and on his own research, Boin opens up a wholly new window onto a period we thought we knew. His work is the first to describe how Christians navigated the complex world of social identity in terms of "passing" and "coming out." Many Christians lived in a dynamic middle ground. Their quiet success, as much as the clamor of martyrdom, was a powerful agent for change. With this insightful approach to the story of Christians in the Roman world, Douglas Boin rewrites, and rediscovers, the fascinating early history of a world faith.</p></p><p><b>Douglas Boin</b> is an expert on the religious history of the Roman Empire.

This book opens up the homes of individuals and couples to show how they use d�cor to give their residences a sense of history and autobiography.

One of the places I found privacy was in books. I could be anywhere at all, but if I was reading it book I was by in myself. Sometimes it was hard for me to get books. In the 1950s, when I was a child, the South was rigidly segregated. The Demopolis Public library was for whites; I black child could not go there. My mother arranged for a white friend to get books from the library for me. Many years later, I returned to Demopolis and gave some of the books I had written to the library I could never enter as a child. Some Years after that, I was invited to give an important speech it that same library.</p><p>"I attended high school in Boston, Massachuetts, and college in a variety of places, the first of which was Alabama State University in Montgomery. It Was the time of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which began after a black woman named osa Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a city bus to a white man. Inspired by her action and led by a young minister Martin Luther King, Jr., black people boycotted the buses for more than a year until the United States Supreme Court ruled that segregation on public buses was unconstitutional. I helped hand out leaflets urging black people to stay off the buses and Was expelled front the college for doing so. Georgetown University In Washington, D.C., then offered me a scholarship, and I enrolled there.</p><p>"After graduating from college, I moved to New York, where I sold newspaper advertising space and worked as a stock trader on Wall Street before I decided to become a teacher. I taught music and special education classes in Harlem; My first book, <em>Diary Of a Schoolteacher,</em> was a result of my experiences.</p><p>"It was the 1960s, and college and high school Students were demonstrating against the war in Vietnam and for the civil rights of black people. My students were aware of those events and wanted to know more about them. But there were no books written on their level. So I started writing books for young people about the various movements--antiwar, civil rights, black power. After that I began writing biographies of black people, because young people black and white--like to read about how successful people grew up and overcame the barriers of poverty and racial discrinination.</p><p>"Since the early 1970s, I have taught on the collage level, and I have continued to write books. I have published more than 125 on many subjects for children, young adults, and adults. In 1994, the <em>Washington Post</em> Children's Book Guild honored me for my body of work in nonfiction for children.</p><p>"I have learned a lot from writing books. I have also met many important people, including Mrs. Rosa Parks herself, because I helped her write her autobiographies for young adults, <em>Rosa Park: My Story</em>; and for children, <em>I Am Rosa Parks</em>. When I think about that, I am amazed that the woman who was so important to my experiences as a young college student--not to mention the whole civil rights movement--now my friend.</p><p>"Books were once--and still are--a way to find my own private world. But they have also introduced me to a world far larger than I would otherwise have experienced. I love books, and I feel very fortunate to have been able to share this love With so many People."</p><br><br><p>Floyd Cooper received a Coretta Scott King Award for his illustrations in <em>The Blacker the Berry</em> and a Coretta Scott King Honor for <em>Brown Honey in Broomwheat Tea</em> and <em>I Have Heard of a Land</em>.

In 1984, he came to New York City to pursue a career as an illustrator of books, and he now lives in Easton, Pennsylvania, with his wife and children.</p><br><br><p><b>In Her Own Words...</b></p> <p>"I was born in New Hampshire and spent my first five years in the small town of Winchester. One of my earliest memories is of the two marble busts of great men (I don&#x2019;t remember who they were) that graced the entryway of the town&#x2019;s public library. I am told that I got my first library card when I was three, and that I insisted that I could write my own name on the card and did not want my mother to do it.</p><p>"My parents divorced when I was very young. When I was five, my mother remarried and we moved to Connecticut. The small house into which we moved had an unfinished upstairs, and my stepfather worked nights after work and weekends to create bedrooms for my stepbrother, who was two years older, and me. In my bedroom he built a knotty-pine shelf across the front of the room, and my mother made a pink fabric skirt for it. It was there that I nestled with a flashlight and read after I should have been in bed. I liked to read books in series&#x2014;the Bobbsey twins books and a series about a little girl named Mayda come to mind. I also enjoyed biographies. I could not have been more than eight when I proudly announced to friends and relatives that I was reading thirty books a month.</p><p>"At the University of Connecticut, I became interested in history and enrolled in the first black history course taught at the school. While I was still in college, I worked two summers at the Museum of the City of New York, which is dedicated to the history of New York City. I then took a full-time job in the museum&#x2019;s education department, and many years later I am still there. I started the New York City History Fair, which is part of the National History Day program, and I enjoy helping students do historical research and using what they have learned to create projects for the History Fair. To me, there is nothing more exciting (and sometimes frustrating) than the &#x201c;detective work&#x201d; one has to do to uncover the past through primary documents. I serve on various committees and panels of archivists and historians, whose aim is to bring history to life for young people. I also coordinate the museum&#x2019;s exhibitions with outside community and cultural organizations whose work is making history now.</p><p>"I have written one work of fiction, published many years ago and long out of print. Joseph on the Subway Trains was about a little boy who got separated from his class while traveling on the subway to visit a museum. Even that book was based on an actual incident involving a class visiting the Museum of the City of New York (the little boy was eventually located at a faraway subway station). But I prefer to write nonfiction, because what actually happens to real people is more exciting to me than anything I can make up."</p>Grade 3 UpAThis informative picture book is a handsomely illustrated overview of Africa's ancient empires. From thousands of years ago when the Sahara was green and fertile, to the peak of the African slave trade in the late 1700's, many cultures flourished. Readers learn that Egypt was once ruled by the Kushites, whose kings were shown in temple and tomb depictions as black pharaohs. European explorers and exploiters ignored the continent's past in their preoccupation with treasure. The slaves who survived the brutal journey of the Middle Passage brought with them their rich oral history and traditions, eventually blending elements of their cultures with those of the New World in North, Central, and South America. There is just enough information in the text to leave children curious to learn more about these ancient empires, and the extensive bibliography points to more detailed sources. Cooper's understated paintings in muted colors effectively convey a feeling of strength and power. His oil wash on boards technique gives a textured antique appearance to the beautiful double-page spreads. A stunning introduction to African history.AEunice Weech, M. L.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>Indecent Exposure, Tom Sharpe's second South African novel, is a brilliant follow-up to his Riotous Assembly, which the Sunday Mirror called, "One of the most savagely hilarious satires ever, a startlingly original first novel." Once again the setting is Piemburg, the deceptively peaceful looking capital of Zululand, where Kommandant van Heerden, Konstabel Els and Luitenant Verkramp continue to terrorize true Englishmen and even truer Zulus in their relentless search for a perfect South Africa. <p>While Kommandant van Heerden gropes his way towards true "Englishness" in the company of the eccentric Dornford Yates Club, Luitenant Verkramp, whose hatred of all things English is surpassed only by his fear of sex, sets in motion an experiment in mass chastity with the help of the redoubtable lady psychiatrist Dr. von Blimenstein; their efforts are rewarded by remarkable and quite unforeseen results. Meanwhile, the Kommandant, riding to hounds in the Aardvark mountains, succumbs to the bizarre charms of Mrs. Heathcote-Kilkoon, as Luitenant Verkramp's essays in counter-espionage backfire in the bird sanctuary. Once more, Konstabel Els, homicidal to the last, saves the day-or what's left of it-in one of the most savage hunts ever chronicled in fiction. </p><p>And if you've ever wondered why Tom Sharpe, as a young man, was deported from South Africa (but not before enjoying its unique prisons), you need only read Indecent Exposure and its companion, Riotous Assembly. </p><p>"Sharpe is far more satisfying than Kingsley Amis or any other nasty Brit novelists since Evelyn Waugh."--Roy Blount, Jr. </p><p>"His description of the stupidity and brutality of the South African police-in Riotous Assembly and Indecent Exposure-remains one of the funniest passages in modern fiction."--Auberon Waugh </p><p>"The funniest writer now working in the English language.... His humor has bite and an angry underside that puts him in the great tradition of the English satirists."--Stephen King </p><p>"I cannot think of anyone except Peter DeVries who has anything like his background and charm of style."--Robertson Davies </p><p>"The funniest novelist in English today."--The Washington Post Book World </p><p>"Tom Sharpe is the funniest novelist writing today."--The Times (London) </p><p>"A master of the British comic tradition, as savvy and savage as Evelyn Waugh... as dazzlingly inventive and bizarrely original as P.G. Wodehouse."--Detroit News </p><p>"Like all good humorists, Sharpe is serious and his observations are disturbingly close to truth. Unequivocally the best thing to happen to English comic prose since Wodehouse died and Waugh got religion."--The Plain Dealer </p><p>"He's a desperately funny writer.... Something has driven him to the very boundaries of good taste in vocabulary and fictional event. His fiction is by turns ribald, farcical, satiric, silly, raucous, preposterous, political, irreverent, and wonderful-it succeeds through excess, suggesting a coarser Evelyn Waugh or P.G. Wodehouse leavened by Monty Python."--The Christian Science Monitor </p><p>"Imagine a comic novel that sounds as if it came from the same source as Monty Python, Benny Hill, Fawlty Towers, and the early films of Peter Sellers...."--The Washington Post </p><p>Tom Sharpe was born in England in 1928 and educated at Cambridge. He emigrated to South Africa in 1951, but was deported in 1961. From 1963 to 1972 he was a lecturer in history at the Cambridge College of Arts and Technology. He is the author of eight other novels and two non-fiction books, Riotous Assembly and Indecent Exposure, about South Africa. He is married and lives in Cambridge.</p>Set in South Africa, this broad, brutal farce begins when AfrikaansKommandant van Heerden, chief of police in the little town of Piemburg, takes a short vacation. While he indulges his Anglophile tendencies by trying to ingratiate himself with some would-be upper-class Britons, Liutenantthis is Afrikaans spelling Verkramp decides to make his part of South Africa safe from the communist threat once and for all. This he undertakes by blowing up the town's main facilities and by arresting and torturing the main citizens. Then, upon the suggestion of libidinous psychiatrist Dr. von Blimenstein, Verkramp subjects all police officers to aversion therapy to keep them away from black women. The experiment goes awry, and the police force becomes homosexual. Called back from his vacation after cuckolding his host on a fox hunt, van Heerden finds Piemburg a shambles and a raving mad Verkramp about to marry Dr. von Blimenstein. In the apocalyptic climax, van Heerden saves face with his superiors while exacting revenge on his snobbish former hosts. This timely satire will strike readers either as hilarious or beside the point. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Run and Hike, Play and Bike: What Is Physical Activity?

The story opens with young Peter's first look at the engine - blue boiler and red wheels, puffing smoke and hissing steam, gears spinning and rods stroking back and forth - and old Mr. Torgrimson's wise prediction: "You know, Peter, you're witnessing the beginning of real scientific farming."<br><br>This is Peter's own story of how he and his little sister Anna learned to farm, and how it all changes the day Mr. Parker's steam-threshing rig rumbles onto their place. All the neighbors come to help, and so does Aunt Mavis with her recipe for buffalo-berry pie and her stories about the children's pioneer Norwegian grandparents. Threshing begins when the engine's whistle awakens the threshers, bundle pitchers, and wagon teams, and calls them to work in the darkness long before dawn. While the men thresh the grain, the women and girls prepare five meals a day for a horde of hungry threshermen. The end of the workday comes only when darkness falls again. For Peter and Anna summer brings long days of hard work, reunion with family and friends, and some sadness too.<br><br>Beyond this tale of Peter and his family is the story of steam power on the American farm. It was the steam traction engine - the first farm "tractor" - that plowed America's vast prairie grasslands and threshed the fields of wheat stretching to the horizons. Thrashin' Time is about growing up on a farm in the midst of fundamental change, but even more it is a tribute in words and pictures to America's farm families and a long-gone way of life.</p><p>Peter (12) has heard a lot about steam engines, and he even saw one thrashing wheat at a neighbor's last year, but now the big steam tractor is coming to his farm. He and his six-year-old sister, Anna, get to stay home from school, but have to work hard--Anna makes 200 rolls a day for the hungry thrashers, while Peter drives the water wagon to keep the big engine supplied. Best, he gets to help Mr. Parker, the engineer, keep the engine running--and Mr. Parker even gives Peter his old engineering books as a parting gift. This window on the past depicts farm life in North Dakota just after the turn of the century, at the dawn of modern farm mechanization, with painstaking verisimilitude. The meticulous pen drawings of the tractor, separator, and thrashers are large, handsome, and full of engrossing detail. As narrated by Peter, the story is chiefly a vehicle for conveying a sense of time and place--food, people, tasks; still, here, too, the authentic detail holds interest. Some historical notes would have helped-- 15 storytellers are credited, but who were they? How much of the story is fact? And, though a carefully labeled drawing of the tractor is included, there are few technical details. All in all, however, an attractive book that does what it sets out to do. (Nonfiction. 11+) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grade 4 Up-- Tucka-tucka-tucka-tucka-tucka--ss--ss--ss--ss--The sounds of a steam-driven thrashing machine have passed into history, and nearly from the memory of most adults. So how are children to learn about this romanticized fragment of American past? Thrashin' Time should fill that information gap, and provide much visual enjoyment. This is a startlingly beautiful book, painstakingly typeset, with white space ample enough to suggest effortless reading. The prose is colorful, but as good as the writing is, the real power of the book is in Weitzman's fine line drawings, many on a double-page spread, each one frameable. He includes not only drawings of the steam engine at work, detailed labeled models, but also extraordinary illustrations of people involved in various aspects of thrashing: the crew at rest, the man driving the horse-drawn mower, the women preparing the much-lauded noon meal. This may not be a book that children will pick up automatically, but, once introduced, it will be appreciated by a wide audience. --Lee Bock, Brown County Public Libraries, Green Bay, WI<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>His Mouth will Taste of Wormwood (Penguin 60s)</h2><p>&#39;Penis Is as Penis Does&#39; is a book of truth and question.

Going back to Bram Stoker's original novel, Elrod (Time of the Vampires) asked contributors to this anthology, "What ELSE was Dracula doing in London when he was not being chased by Van Helsing and company?" Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, in "Long-Term Investment," and Fred Saberhagen, in "Box Number Fifty," both have him duping ignorant human associates into elaborate schemes to conceal his coffins. Tanya Huff suggests he was drawn to social climbers and other predatory personalities in "To Each His Own Kind." In one of the book's most intriguing entries, Judith Proctor's "Dear Mr. Bernard Shaw," he is a theater patron who cannot understand how the deaths at the end of King Lear ennoble human suffering. Inevitably, Dracula rubs shoulders with a variety of Victorian-era celebrities, including Gilbert and Sullivan, Doctor Watson, Prince Edward, actress Ellen Terry and even a young Aleister Crowley. Inventive though they often are, few of these stories capture the subtle malignancy and terrifying misanthropy that has made Stoker's creation an indelible horror icon. Excepting Gene DeWeese's "An Essay on Containment" and Gary A. Braunbeck's "Curtain Call," which attempt to be more than mere outtakes from Stoker's tale, the majority are modern revisionist interpretations of Dracula as lover, dreamer, swashbuckler and bungler. For better or worse, they bear out the editor's professed fondness for any Dracula variation, "good and bad, sublime and silly." <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Complete Book of Topiary</h2><p>Presenting all the methods of formal plant shaping and introducing simple, fun, and fanciful techniques for creating informal indoor topiaries, <i>Totally Topiary</i> is clear, comprehensive, and written with an irrepressible passion for the art of making plants into living sculpture.<br><br>From hedge sculpture and espalier to indoor creations and an entire chapter on ivy, all major topiary styles both new and old are covered.

He lives near Seattle.Cloth streamers hung from the front door of the fortune teller&#x2019;s hooch; bright red, yellow, and green. Tiny bells tied to the streamers tinkled in the late afternoon breeze. Doctor Yong In-ja, chief of the Itaewon branch of the Yongsan District Public Health Service, pulled three sticks of incense out of her pocket, struck a single wooden match against a dirty brick wall, and lit all three. She handed one to me, one to the young business girl I knew only as Miss Kwon, and kept the last for herself. Pungent smoke assaulted my nostrils. Turning, Doc Yong pushed open the small wooden door in the front wall and crouched through into the fortune teller&#x2019;s courtyard.<br>My name is George Sue�o. I&#x2019;m an agent for the Criminal Investigation Division of the 8th United States Army in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Normally, I don&#x2019;t seek consultations with fortune tellers. But when Doc Yong asked me to accompany her and the traumatized Miss Kwon to see the woman whom she referred to as &#x201c;the most famous chom-cheingi in Seoul,&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t refuse.<br>Miss Kwon was a cute kid, about nineteen years old, with cheeks that quivered like a chipmunk&#x2019;s. I had first seen her in Doc Yong&#x2019;s office some twenty minutes ago. She had been so nervous at meeting me that her hands shook. I spoke to her in Korean, using polite verb endings, and she calmed down, but only a bit. Miss Kwon&#x2019;s fear of men&#x2014;especially Americans&#x2014;was vast. Doc Yong had asked me to meet with her, talk to her, and eventually to accompany the two of them on this outing to the fortune teller, thinking I could show Miss Kwon the positive side of Western manhood: not drunk, not aggressive, not treating women as objects to be bought and sold. I&#x2019;d been flattered by Doc&#x2019;s confidence and, more to the point, grateful that she had never seen me running the ville on a Saturday night.<br>Although she was escorting a superstitious young country girl to a fortune teller, Doc Yong had confided in me before we left that as a modern woman and a medical doctor, she did not believe in such nonsense herself. But Doc Yong felt that a visit to Auntie Mee, the fortune teller, would reassure Miss Kwon, give her hope that she had a future worth working toward, a future that would be better than the present she was suffering through now.<br>And, Doc Yong finally admitted, when we were already halfway there, that the chom-cheingi also wanted to speak to me. Me specifically, I&#x2019;d asked, or just anyone representing 8th Army law enforcement? You specifically, Doc Yong had replied. The fortune teller had asked for me by name: Sue�o. I asked how she had known my name. Doc Yong shook her head. But I could figure it out. Itaewon was a small village and word gets around. Quick. The fact that my partner, Ernie Bascom, and I were Criminal Investigation Division agents was no secret. What did this chom-cheingi want to talk to me about? Doc Yong shook her head again. I&#x2019;d find out soon enough.<br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure I liked being maneuvered into meeting someone I wouldn&#x2019;t normally encounter. I consider fortune tellers to be charlatans, people who use trickery to prey on the insecurities of people&#x2014;mostly women&#x2014;who shell out hard-earned money and receive little or nothing in return. But if Doc Yong considered it worthwhile for me to talk to this woman I&#x2019;d set my misgivings aside. That was good enough for me.<br>Frankly, I would&#x2019;ve followed Doc Yong anywhere. We did a lot of work with her&#x2014;what with Korean &#x201c;business girls&#x201d; being constantly beat up or raped or even occasionally tortured by our brave American fighting men&#x2014;and I wanted to retain her goodwill. But the main reason I decided to join her on this gray afternoon was that I had a crush on her. She was probably in her early thirties, about seven or eight years older than me, and she had legs that were maybe a little too short and a chest that wouldn&#x2019;t make any Hollywood starlet jealous. Her face was round and never made up and, on top of that, she wore thick-rimmed glasses and cut her hair in a straight bob that hung just past her ears.<br>But I found her attractive because of her smile. It was brighter than the sun coming up over the Eastern Sea and filled whoever was lucky enough to see it with a sense of vibrant optimism. And her skin was pure, unblemished, the color of light gold with just a hint of brown. It sounds like a lousy pick-up line but I was also attracted to her mind. When I gazed into her eyes I could see her evaluating me, turning everything I said this way and that, not coming to a conclusion but storing data, ready to reach a conclusion when, and only when, it became necessary. She was the only person I knew who, when I gazed into her eyes, I was certain was more intelligent than me.<br>Admittedly, I didn&#x2019;t live in a world of massive brain power. Most of the people I worked with were Army MPs, Korean cops, or miscreant criminals of either Korean or American vintage. Every time I talked to Doc Yong I felt as if I&#x2019;d been hit by a breath of fresh air blowing in off the cold Yellow Sea.<br>Now we sat in the courtyard holding our sticks of burning incense for what seemed a long time, squatting on our haunches. Or maybe it just seemed like a long time because my thigh muscles had started to cramp. After a few minutes I had to stand up and stretch. Doc Yong motioned me back down.<br>The courtyard was like most courtyards of the working class poor: a byonso&#x2014;an outhouse&#x2014;made of cement blocks sat in one corner, earthenware kimchee pots lined the side walls, and in the center of the courtyard were a few scraggly rose bushes, barren now in the middle of winter, reaching toward gray clouds like the gnarled fingers of the dead. Miss Kwon held her stick of incense straight up in front of her face with both hands and remained totally immobile, except for her lips which mumbled an incomprehensible prayer. Doc Yong did pretty much the same except her eyes darted about occasionally. My legs were so stiff and the joints of my knees ached so badly that I was about to stand and call the whole thing off when footsteps pattered on the raised wooden floor of the hooch. Silently, the latticework door slid open. A woman stepped onto the porch and bowed.<br>She wasn&#x2019;t what I expected; not a withered crone with a hooked nose and warts. Auntie Mee was a slender Korean woman, maybe in her thirties, clad in robes of embroidered blue silk. She bowed at the waist, and thanked us in a melodious voice for being good enough to join her in her humble household. We all stood. Doc Yong bowed first and then Miss Kwon and then me. Following Doc Yong&#x2019;s lead, we placed our burning incense sticks into a bronze holder encircled by rose bushes. Auntie Mee motioned for us to enter. We slipped off our shoes, stepped up onto the varnished wooden porch and ducked through the doorway onto the vinyl-covered floor of the home of the fortune teller.<br>We followed her down a dark hallway and emerged into a rear courtyard. This one was far better kept, with bonsai trees, ponds with tiny waterfalls and golden carp frolicking in the green water. Fortune-telling paid well. We followed a long porch around the edge of the courtyard to the rear. Auntie Mee bowed once more and led us into a room, twice as big as the hooch up front. It held a shrine. Above flickering candles, many pairs of huge round eyes glared at me: the Conquering General of Heaven, the Goddess of the Land Below, sleek copper Buddhas, fat bronze kitchen gods. Just about every sort of religion was represented here. A bearded figure in one of the murals seemed to be Jesus Christ.<br>Miss Kwon appeared completely awed. She knelt in the center of the room and bowed her head to the floor. Turning from us, Auntie Mee covered herself in a thick red robe, strode into the middle of the room, and squatted in front of Miss Kwon. Gently, she took the girl&#x2019;s quivering hands in hers. Auntie Mee closed her eyes and began to chant. The two of them seemed to be engaged in a spiritual communion. Neither moved but they held on to one another firmly. Finally, softly, Auntie Mee began to speak.<br>She asked Miss Kwon for her date of birth and then her hour of birth. After that she pulled a small table away from the wall and began to thumb through a sheaf of loose-leafed pages, tattered at the edges and held together by copper studs. In the center of the title page sat three characters; the one in the middle was too complicated for me to read but those on either end were composed of only a few strokes. By the flickering candlelight, Auntie Mee&#x2019;s finger traced row after row of Chinese characters, elegantly slashed thick lines made by an ink-dipped horsehair brush. Many of the manuscript pages were partially blank, as if chunks were missing.<br>Auntie Mee stopped&#x2014;still mumbling to herself&#x2014;and seized three large bronze coins with small squares punched in the middle. She threw them up in the air and allowed them to clatter to the surface of the wooden table. When they had stopped moving, she took note of how they landed and resumed her search through the grimy stack of curled paper. Finally, she grabbed Miss Kwon&#x2019;s hand, and started chanting again.<br>I could follow little of what she said. Much of the incantation was whispered in Miss Kwon&#x2019;s ear, so only she could hear it. Also, my Korean is conversational, not completely fluent. If I steer the topic of conversation to areas where my vocabulary is extensive, and if the person I&#x2019;m talking to keeps the words and syntax simple, I can communicate effectively. But when someone takes off into the exotic realms where Auntie Mee was heading, into ancient incantations pulled from the hoary recesses of time, I become lost. Only a few words or phrases seeped in: &#x201c;trouble with your family;&#x201d; &#x201c;men who don&#x2019;t respect you;&#x201d; &#x201c;foreigners who treat Koreans badly.&#x201d;<br>I wondered how much of this was fortune-telling and how much common sense. The Korean economy was desperately trying to rebuild itself in the early seventies, some twenty years after the devastation of the Korean War. Things were tough for the working poor in Seoul and, when crops failed, even tougher for the farmers in the countryside. Despite massive population growth in the cities&#x2014;Seoul was up to eight million people&#x2014;most of the Korean population still lived in agricultural areas. When girls reached marriageable age, they found it difficult to find a husband. Landless boys were not only drafted into the army for three years but afterward they ran off to the cities to find work. The girls were left to labor in factories hoping to build a dowry or, if their grades weren&#x2019;t so good in school, as bus attendants or janitors or scullery maids if they were lucky. The unlucky ones signed contracts with labor recruiters. Money would be sent home to their parents. They would work as &#x201c;hostesses&#x201d; in bars or nightclubs. Hostesses are expected to perform additional duties, duties that encompass prostitution. Often, after poverty and the system has broken them down, the girls give up all hope of living a decent life and plunge into drunkenness and drugs and sex-for-sale. These are the ones who end up being hauled into jail by Korean cops or, occasionally, G.I. cops like me.<br>I&#x2019;m not a fortune teller but I saw all this in Miss Kwon&#x2019;s future. So did Doc Yong. The difference was that Doc Yong was trying to save her. I didn&#x2019;t know how.<br>Now Auntie Mee spoke in a strong clear voice. Miss Kwon was crying and bowing. Auntie Mee asked her an occasional question. Miss Kwon answered. Auntie Mee made what seemed to be pronouncements and Miss Kwon nodded vigorously.<br>During all this, Doc Yong had been sitting quietly, her head bowed. But now her fists clenched and she stared directly at Auntie Mee.<br>&#x201c;Weikurei?&#x201d; Doc Yong demanded. Why this way?<br>Auntie Mee shrugged and gestured toward the tattered manuscript, as if to say, That&#x2019;s what the book told me.<br>Finally, the reading was done and Auntie Mee and Miss Kwon hugged one another. Then Auntie Mee slid backward on her bent knees, and Miss Kwon, crying more than ever, bowed twice. Doc Yong, still scowling, comforted her and dragged her off to the side of the room, away from the glow of the flickering candlelight. They whispered to one another, conferring over the full meaning of the fortune that had just been told.<br>Auntie Mee motioned for me to sit before her. I slid across the floor and knelt, although my butt wouldn&#x2019;t descend as low as Auntie Mee&#x2019;s. My head towered a foot above hers. She backed up a little, uncomfortable looking up at me.<br>Many Koreans find Westerners unattractive. Upsetting, even. Our features are too gross, our bone structure too oddly shaped, our bodies too massive and reeking of the odor of meat. Apparently, that was Auntie Mee&#x2019;s attitude.<br>When she had put some distance between us she relaxed, arranged her blue robe around herself and began to talk, speaking Korean slowly and simply so I could understand.<br>First, she asked me for my date of birth. I wouldn&#x2019;t give it to her.<br>&#x201c;Why? Don&#x2019;t you want your fortune read?&#x201d;<br>I shook my head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe in these things,&#x201d; I said.<br>She seemed greatly amused. &#x201c;But many people do.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Many people do a lot of things,&#x201d; I replied.<br>&#x201c;As you wish.&#x201d; Auntie Mee sighed and slammed shut her pile of dog-eared pages. Then, still in Korean, she said something to me. It was a jarring change of subject and it took me a few moments to translate the sentence, mentally, into English.&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I want you to arrest someone,&#x201d; she told me.<br>I waited.<br>&#x201c;A compatriate of yours,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;An American soldier.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What has he done?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;He bothers me every night. Wakes me. Makes me rise from my bed and forces me to light sticks of incense and speaks to me through the Conquering General of Heaven. He even interrupts me when I&#x2019;m working with my clients, causing delays and confusing my readings. He&#x2019;s quite a pest. Rude, like so many of you Americans. And impatient too.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Impatient?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. Why doesn&#x2019;t he wait to take his revenge in the land of the dead like everyone else? Why must he bother me to take action on his behalf, here in the land of the living? What has he ever done for me?&#x201d;<br>I was more confused than ever. &#x201c;This American soldier,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He is your boyfriend? He lives with you?&#x201d;<br>The smooth contours of Auntie Mee&#x2019;s face twisted into a sneer. Doc Yong and Miss Kwon had both stopped talking.<br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Auntie Mee shouted so emphatically that I could scarcely believe the sound emanated from so slender a woman. &#x201c;He visits me at night,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He awakens me. He interrupts me when I am in trance. He bothers me always and he won&#x2019;t go away until someone finds his bones.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;His bones?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. His bones. They are buried in Itaewon. I don&#x2019;t know exactly where, but as to when he said something about &#x2018;at the beginning of peace.&#x2019; Shortly after the end of the war.&#x201d;<br>The cease fire ending the Korean War was signed in July of 1953. That was over twenty years ago. Still, the implications of Auntie Mee&#x2019;s words hadn&#x2019;t fully sunk in.<br>&#x201c;Whose bones is he talking about?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;His bones.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then he&#x2019;s dead?&#x201d;<br>Auntie Mee sighed, sat back, and crossed her arms. &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br>I glanced at Doc Yong. She nodded her head slightly in agreement.<br>I turned back to Auntie Mee. &#x201c;What do you want me to do about it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Find his bones. Send them back to America, back to his family, so they can be consecrated or whatever you people do with them.

Fortunately, John Ceepak, the cop with a soldier&#x2019;s unshakeable code of honor, stays at Danny&#x2019;s side to help him negotiate the quick twists and turns that threaten to destroy his life, his friends, and everything about the world he loves. Whipping from the boardwalk to the beach and back again, <i>Mad Mouse</i> keeps zigging and zagging at a breakneck pace, all the way to the surprising finish.<br></p><p>Chris Grabenstein was the first writer hired as a result of James Patterson&#x2019;s famous advertising aptitude test that ran in the New York Times when Patterson was Creative Director of J. Walter Thompson. Now he is following in his mentor&#x2019;s footsteps with his debut mystery novel. Chris spent several years at the nations top ad agencies.

A member of Mystery Writers of America, Chris lives in New York City.<br><br>Set on a colorful Jersey Shore boardwalk, graced with a Bruce Springsteen soundtrack, and starring an aw-shucks charming pair of cop buddies, Grabenstein's second seaside amusement-park-ride mystery lives up to the promise of his smash-hit debut, <i>Tilt-a-Whirl</i> (2005). Easygoing part-time summer cop Danny Boyle is hoping to be promoted to full-time rookie, so he pays close attention to his impressive partner, John Ceepak, a decorated Iraq War veteran whose extreme correctness and keen intelligence are matched by a low-key bigheartedness. Sea Haven is gearing up for a gigantic Labor Day celebration, and Danny is falling hard for Katie, but summer fun is cruelly interrupted by a sniper stalking Danny, Katie, and their friends, and leaving calling cards featuring Derek Jeter and comic-book superheroes. As the mayor pressures the cops to find this taunting killer before the holiday festivities begin, cool Ceepak and bumbling Boyle wield their superpowers: kindness, honesty, and courage. With agile humor, neat plotting, unexpected sweetness, and an irresistible duo, Grabenstein offers a hip new form of cozy. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A young husband must decide whether or not to commit a ghoulish crime; a baseball player in a fantastic 1930s Coney Island is assailed by the guilt of an illicit romance; a nineteenth-century itinerant dentist finds himself snowed in with a group of trappers for a long evening of primitive surgery and laughing gas reveries. Whether they're set in the past or the present, tinged with the macabre, the solemn, or the absurd, all of the stories in this collection carry the weight of real emotion and revelation and showcase King's impressive versatility. </p><p>In his novella, King tells the story of George, the teenage son of a single mother, and the only grandson of a family of union organizers in Maine. George's grandfather Henry, obsessed with the outcome of the 2000 election, has planted a giant billboard of homage to Al Gore in his front yard that he suspects has been defaced by the paperboy, now a sworn enemy. Meanwhile, George's mother is about to marry Dr. Vic, who, besides being possessed of an almost royal obliviousness, may even have voted for George W. Bush. George is a nervous accomplice to his grandfather's increasingly unhinged behavior, and a righteous adversary at war with his mother over her marriage. George's struggle is a funny and moving parallel for our times: How will we fight? All together, or all alone? Funny, insightful, and always entertaining, We're All in This Together launches the career of an extraordinarily talented writer.</p></p><p><p>Owen King grew up in Bangor, Maine. He is a graduate of Vassar College and holds an M.F.A. from Columbia University, and his stories have appeared in Book Magazine and the Bellingham Review. He has been nominated for a National Magazine Award and is a recipient of the John Gardner Award for Short Fiction. He currently resides in Brooklyn.</p>From the 26-year-old scion of literary giant Stephen King comes a compelling, imaginative debut collection of four short stories both creepy and heartfelt, plus a compassionate novella about a 15-year-old son of a single mother. Set in Maine around the 2000 election, the title novella captures the teenage narrator's anger over his mother's impending marriage to Dr. Vic, while his family, led by a union organizer grandfather, seethes over Bush's election. George lays siege to his mother's relationship and helps his grandfather build a sniper's nest from which to attack the paperboy who defaces the old man's "Al Gore is the Real President" sign. Freaks and weirdos&#x2014;external symptoms of his protagonists' inner struggles&#x2014;people King's shorter stories, which strive to balance the lurid with a reach for emotional truth. In "Wonders," about a baseball player who takes his pregnant girlfriend to a Coney Island circus freak abortionist, the macabre and the heartfelt feel discordant, and the story ends with unearned violence.

In this fantastic tale, a sprightly new translation of Cazotte's 1772 classic Le diable amoureux , a young Spanish nobleman makes an impetuous boast to his drinking buddies that he will "tweak great Satan's ears." The spirits are conjured, and though uninitiated in the supernatural, Alvaro boldly commands the devil--who then appears in the form of an enchanting page, Biondetto, first male, then female. Alvaro is delighted, then horrified to discover that the page is in love with him and pledges to serve him for life. With finely drawn details Cazotte imbues Biondetta with dazzling human qualities: Alvaro is smitten and his fate sealed. Also included are a biography of Cazotte by the critic Gerard de Nerval, which serves as a primary bibliography of the entire genre, and Cazotte's "Revelations," which some believe prophesied the French Revolution (in which Cazotte himself was guillotined).

Fort Elliott fired a cannon every daybreak, dancehall girls courted gamblers in Old Mobeetie, and vast herds of sheep and cattle grazed the rolling plains. &#x201c;Footings&#x201d; for &#x201c;nesters&#x201d; were not easily had, so the ever-growing Jones family farmed, freighted, and herded sheep before establishing a ranch in Wheeler County. Sisters Millie and Leanna later described their childhoods in various books, published and unpublished &#x2014; yet the Jones family story has never really been told in full until now. <br>What began as a puzzle of passages from four disparate books is now reordered into a shared life story in two parts. &#x201c;The Jones Girls&#x201d; utilizes two unpublished memoirs and two published books: Leanna Jones Harvey&#x2019;s 1940 novel, "Generation unto Generation," and Millie Jones Porter&#x2019;s 1945 area history, "Memory Cups of Panhandle Pioneers." Each sister tells her version of a shared family history. Two memoirs verify the truth of Leanna&#x2019;s &#x201c;novel,&#x201d; and Millie&#x2019;s personal &#x201c;memory cups&#x201d; add color and context to a vivid depiction of life in the early Texas Panhandle.</p><p>Ruth Rogers Beasley set out to make an archive of the family books, and assembled this dual memoir when she discovered the larger story hidden within the writings of Millie and Leanna Jones.</p><h2>Hornby: The Official Illustrated History</h2><p>The model train set is the archetypal toy, and the archetypal British model rail train is a Hornby.&nbsp; Hornby: The Official Illustrated History is the first full pictorial account of the rise and development of the three main model railway systems that have borne the famous Hornby name over the last 82 years.

She plans to make her comeback by turning temporary DJ Charlie Tenniel into a household name. And if he's willing to help cure her breakup blues with a rebound fling, that's an added bonus.<p>Charlie just wants to kick back, play good tunes and eat Chinese food. He's not interested in becoming famous. But he <i>is</i> interested in Allie. And after all, what harm is a little chemistry between friends?</p><p>But suddenly their one-night stand has become a four-week addiction. Night after night on the airwaves, his voice seduces her...and all the other women in town. He's a hit. It looks as if Charlie's solved all Allie's problems...except one. What is she going to do when he leaves?</p></p><p>Jennifer Crusie is the New York Times, Publishers Weekly, and USA Today bestselling author of Tell Me Lies, Crazy for You, Welcome to Temptation, Faking It, Fast Women, and Bet Me.<br><br>Allie McGuffey knew a yuppie bar was a lousy place to find a hero, but she was desperate, so she had to make do with what she had on hand.<br><br>Unfortunately, what she had on hand was pretty pathetic.<br><br>She shoved her horn-rimmed glasses back up the bridge of her nose with one finger and peered at the row of stools at the bar. Businessman. Businessman. Empty seat. Businessman. Businesswoman. Empty seat. Empty seat. Thug. Businessman.<br><br>She swallowed the lump that had been in her throat for the past fifteen minutes. Okay, fine, if that's what she had to work with, she'd work with it. But it was going to have to be the thug, because she was never going to have a relationship with a suit again as long as she lived. Even a relationship that was only going to last five minutes.<br><br>And he really wasn't a thug. Allie tried to drum up some enthusiasm before she made her move. His dark blond hair was shaggy over his collar, and his brown leather jacket had seen better days, and his jeans were authentic grunge, but he was big and clean and most important of all, he made a nice contrast to all the charcoal suits that looked like Mark. And what Allie wanted more than anything right then was a not-Mark.<br><br>She knew she was behaving like an idiot, but given the bomb that had just exploded in her face, the fact that she was not sitting in a trance was a step in the right direction.<br><br>It had not been a good day.<br><br>Allie had hit the radio-station doors that afternoon at her usual clip, banging them open like saloon doors. If they ever locked those doors, she was going to seriously hurt herself, but they never did since everyone had to be buzzed in from the street level four floors below. So she'd gone charging through as usual, happy to be there. As usual, what seemed like forty people converged on her.<br><br>Allie beamed as they pounced, loving the feeling that WBBB couldn't run without her, that without her there would be dead air and dust. This was who she was, Allie-the-producer, Allie-the-brains-behind-The-Mark-King-Show, Allie-the-savior. She knew she was probably a little whacked to depend on a radio station for her identity, but compared to all the other psychological problems running loose at the station, she was in relatively good mental health, so she didn't dwell on it.<br><br>At first it was just Karen, the receptionist, who called out "Allie!" but that alerted Lisa, her former student intern, who popped out of the hall looking miserable and said, "Allie, I&#x2014;" and who was promptly pushed aside by Albert the financial manager, who said, "Allie, the ratings&#x2014;" and who was overrun by Marcia, the two-to-six-time-slot barracuda, who said, "Allie, I heard&#x2014;" and who was shouldered aside by Mark, Allie's ex-lover and present boss, who said, "I need to see you in your office. Now."<br><br>Allie pushed her glasses back up her nose so she could see him better. The silence that settled over the reception area was a tribute to how bizarrely Mark was behaving. Usually, he made his presence known through talking too loudly, dropping names and laughing heartily in the wrong places. Allie had once felt sorry for him, but she didn't now, having been dumped as his lover two months ago when he decided he'd look better standing next to Lisa than he did with her. He was right, of course, but it still hurt to look at him now. He stood in the entrance to the hallway, quietly superior, and it was such a change that everybody shut up and she followed him to her office without question.<br><br>Once inside, he closed the door behind her, went around to her desk chair and sat.<br><br>Allie fought back a snarl. All right, she wasn't territorial, but this was her office, no matter how tiny and cluttered, and her desk, and that was her desk chair, and he was making her a visitor in her own domain. So she scowled at him and said, "What is this?"<br><br>Mark crossed his arms and leaned back in her chair, which tilted so that he was almost horizontal to her vertical, and then he said, "There's no good way to tell you this, Allie, so I'll just say it. I know it's going to be hard, but I also know you're an adult and you realize that things change. People grow. Change is good." He let his head fall back and addressed the ceiling as he began to wax philosophic. While Allie waited for him to get to the point, assuming he had one, she considered how amazingly good-looking he was, and how mad she was at him, and how much she wanted him back.<br><br>This was the great mystery of her life. He was an insecure twit. So why had she fallen for him and why was she still hung up on him? Why did she miss going to dinner with him and lying in bed with him, all the while listening to him talk about himself? Of course, that had been research for the show, but still... As he droned on and she automatically began to edit his speech for broadcast purposes, the possibility dawned on her that what she'd fallen for was the edited Mark King she'd created on the radio, not the real Mark King who sat in front of her now, boring her to tears. And that what she was most mad about was that she'd created him, and then he'd taken her work to another woman.<br><br>Mark was still waxing. "So that's why&#x2014;" Allie cut in, more exasperated with herself than with Mark. "Look, I've got things to do here, so if you'll just cut to the chase, I'll get back to keeping you a hit." Okay, that was below the belt, but he'd started the fight by sitting in her chair, the louse. Not to mention dumping her for a younger woman.<br><br>Mark sat up straight and put his palms flat on her desk. "All right, here it is. You're not going to be working on my show anymore."<br><br>The room spun. Allie dropped into the remaining chair in the room and said, "What?"<br><br>"I've sensed a certain hostility since our breakup, and it's affecting my performance. So Bill and I have decided it's best to put Lisa in your place since you've trained her. That way, the show won't suffer at all."<br><br>Allie sat stunned.<br><br>Mark smiled at her and spread his hands, fait accompli. "Lisa is producing the show, starting now. It'll be better for all of us."<br><br>"All of us who? " She took a deep breath. "Not all of us me. You have the drive-time show. I'm the drive-time producer. Unless I get the slot while you and Lisa move someplace cozy, this is not better for me."<br><br>"Well, of course I'm not moving." Mark sat up straighter in the chair. "I'm the talent."<br><br>He was the talent? Then what was she?<br><br>"And you're not fired or anything like that. We do appreciate what you've done," he went on, and Allie jerked her head up, anger finally evicting her panic.<br><br>"Of course I'm not fired. Why would I be fired? This makes no sense."<br><br>He plowed on through her anger. "And Bill's going to give you another show to produce. I made sure of that."<br><br>Good old Mark. Taking care of her. What a pal. She stood up, refraining from killing him where he sat only by Herculean effort. "Well, gee, Mark, thanks for the support and good luck in the future. Now get out of my chair."<br><br>He stood, doing what she'd said as if by instinct. After two years of doing everything she said, it was probably a hard habit to break. He moved toward the door, brimming with patronizing goodwill. "Look, why don't we go out for a drink? Just to show there are no hard feelings."<br><br>She wanted to scream at him, <em>Of course there are hard feelings, you jerk. If I could, I'd beat you senseless with one right now.</em> But she was too adult for that, and too rattled, so she lied instead. Mark might have kicked her in the teeth, but she still had her incisors.<br><br>"Sorry, I've already got a date. In fact, I have to go now. Maybe some other time." She ducked out into the hall in front of him, trying not to cry. That would be a real mistake because she never cried. If she did, people would probably assume somebody had died. And then she'd have to tell them that, tragically, Mark still lived.<br><br>Mark followed her, so she speeded up.<br><br>Karen yelled "Allie" again as she went past the receptionist's counter, and this time shoved an envelope at her. "Bill&#x2014;"<br><br>Allie took the envelope without slowing down, flashing the best smile she could under the circumstances, and bolted for the elevator with Mark still in pursuit.<br><br>Then Karen called out to him, too, and stopped him, and Allie caught the elevator and escaped to the street.<br><br>She'd been fired. She still had a job, but her career was gone with Mark. Allie stuck her chin out and tried to fake defiance&#x2014;well, big deal, she'd just build another great show&#x2014;but it was no good. She'd spent two years making Mark's show a hit, taking surveys, researching topics, devising contests, doing everything she knew to showcase Mark's strengths. She'd majored in Mark King, and now he'd expelled her.<br><br>For a moment, outside the restaurant across from the station, Allie felt a moment of pure fear.<br><br>What if she couldn't do it again? What if Mark was right and he was the talent? What if she really was a loser? Nobody coming to her for help, nobody relying on her.<br><br><em>No.</em> She'd find a way back. She gritted her teeth and went into the restaurant.<br><br>The hallway divided the restaurant from the bar, a sort of DMZ that separated the eating yuppies from the drinking yuppies. Allie stopped there and opened the envelope Karen had thrust at her. She found the kind of note the station owner was famous for: short, tactless and to the point:<br><br>I'm taking you off Mark's show and giving you to Charles Tenniel, the man taking over for Waldo Hancock. Meet him tomorrow, Tuesday, five o'clock, my office. Bill<br><br>Weird Waldo had the 10:00 to 2:00 a.m. spot. She'd just been demoted from producing the radio equivalent of <em>Oprah</em> to the radio equivalent of an infomercial.<br><br>She shoved the note back into the envelope and looked around the hallway. Her roommate Joe who was supposed to meet her wasn't there to comfort her. The hell with it. She was going home.<br><br>She turned around to go back into the street, but outside the door was Mark, greeting people who greeted him back as if he were a celebrity. Which, of course, he was.<br><br>And he was going to come into the bar and find her alone after her big talk about a date because Joe was late again. Not that Joe would have been very impressive as a date, but he would have been more impressive than no date at all.<br><br>So she went into the bar to find a date, and there were all those suits and the thug. She couldn't face another suit, and at least the thug looked like a change of pace, so she went over to the thug and said, "Hi!" as vivaciously as she could. She wasn't vivacious by nature, so she sounded as if she'd been sucking helium, but he turned and looked at her anyway.<br><br>Allie didn't know what she'd been expecting. Maybe some fantasy guy who was even better-looking than Mark, which, in all fairness to Mark, would be impossible, but this guy wasn't even in the running. He had the kind of face that the big, good-natured kids in the back of high-school English classes always have, slightly dopey and comfortable.<br><br>He looked nice. That was about it, but after Mark, it was pretty good.<br><br>Allie plopped her bag down on the bar. "So! You meeting someone?" she asked, still on helium, and looked over her shoulder to check on the Mark situation. All she had to do was keep the thug in conversation until Mark walked in, saw she was with him and left.<br><br>Mark didn't like competition.<br><br>"So, are you?" Allie smiled like a telemarketer. "Meeting someone?" She sat down beside him, praying Mark wouldn't come in.<br><br>And he said, "No. What are you doing?"<br><br>Shortly before Allie picked him up, Charlie had been contemplating his future. It looked complicated and possibly dangerous, so his best plan was to lay low, not make waves, do the job and get out. Investigating the source of an incriminating anonymous letter to a radio station in Tuttle, Ohio, couldn't be that hard. The station wasn't that big. Hell, the <em>town</em> wasn't that big. His biggest problem was going to be pretending to be a disc jockey, and how hard could that be? If his brother had done it stoned, he could certainly do it straight. And he'd made it clear to everybody concerned that he was only around for six weeks, tops. He had things to do, he'd told them, places he had to be in November.<br><br>He hadn't decided yet exactly what place he had to be in November, but he was positive it was somewhere uncomplicated and remote. Especially remote from his father who had taken to asking weird favors lately. Like "Check into this radio station for my old friend Bill..." This was what came of going home for his father's birthday. From now on, he'd just send a card. And as soon as he was done, he was out of here and someplace else. Someplace where he could do something simple for a while, like raise pigs. No, too complicated. He'd raise carrots. You didn't have to feed carrots.<br><br>He'd stopped thinking when somebody had squeaked, "Hi!"<br><br>Charlie had blinked at her, mildly surprised. She didn't look like the vivacious pick-up-a-guy-in-a-bar type. Her sharp brown eyes gleamed behind huge, round, horn-rimmed glasses, and her glossy gold-brown hair swung in a tangled Dutch-boy bob. There was nothing wrong with her nose or mouth, either; good standard-issue all-American-woman features. She just seemed sort of scrubbed to be trolling for guys. The long flowered skirt and oversize vest weren't right for a pickup, either. She looked like a nice, clean kid. Well, she was no kid. Early thirties easy.<br><br>She raised her eyebrows so high they disappeared under her bangs and batted her eyelashes. "So! You meeting someone?" She looked over her shoulder and flopped her bag down on the bar. It looked as if it was made from very old blue flowered carpet. Charlie had never seen anything quite like it so he poked his finger into it. It was fuzzy.<br><br>"Are you?" She smiled at him again, a sort of strained, too-many-teeth, trying-too-hard smile. "Meeting someone?" She sat on the stool beside him.<br><br>"No." Charlie looked at her with interest. "What are you doing?"<br><br>"Picking you up?"<br><br>Charlie shook his head. "I don't think so. What are you really doing?"<br><br>The artificial smile morphed into a genuine scowl, and her perky voice dropped an octave. "I don't believe this. Can't you even pretend on the hope you'll get lucky? "<br><br>"I never pretend. I'm the natural, open type." Charlie considered moving away from her and then rejected the idea. If he left her, he'd never find out what she was up to. And besides, when she'd scowled at him, her voice had gone husky. She had a great low voice. He smiled down at her, trying to make her talk again. "Why don't you just give me the drift, and then we can take it from there."<br><br>She lowered her head a little and stared at him over the rims of her glasses. "Look, the drift will take too long, and besides, it makes me look pathetic. All I ask is that you pretend to be having a drink with me." He must have looked skeptical because she added, "I swear that's it."<br><br></p><h2>Buzzed: The Straight Facts About the Most Used and Abused Drugs from Alcohol to Ecstasy (Third Edition)</h2><p><p><strong>The third edition of the essential, accessible source for understanding how drugs work and their effects on body and behavior.</strong></p><p>Fully revised and updated, this no-nonsense handbook includes the most recent discoveries about drugs, including new information on the energy-drinks craze, prescription drugs such as OxyContin and Ambien, the date-rape drug GHB, and the unique effects of some drugs on the adolescent brain.

She lives in Ireland with her husband and their two imaginary dogs.</p><p>They said I was a drug addict. I found that hard to come to terms with -- I was a middle-class, convent-educated girl whose drug use was strictly recreational. And surely drug addicts were thinner? It was true that I took drugs, but what no one seemed to understand was that my drug use wasn't any different from their having a drink or two on a Friday night after work. They might have a few vodkas and tonic and let off a bit of steam. I had a couple of lines of cocaine and did likewise. As I said to my father and my sister and my sister's husband and eventually the therapists of the Cloisters, "If cocaine was sold in liquid form, in a bottle, would you complain about me taking it? Well, would you? No, I bet you wouldn't!"</p><p>I was offended by the drug-addict allegation, because I was nothing like one. Apart from the track marks on their arms, they had dirty hair, constantly seemed cold, did a lot of shoulder-hunching, wore cheap sneakers that looked like they'd been bought in Woolworth's, and were, as I've already mentioned, thin.</p><p>I wasn't thin.</p><p>Although it wasn't for the want of trying. I spent plenty of timeon the Stairmaster at the gym. But no matter how much I stairmastered, genetics had the final say. If my father had married a dainty little woman, I might have had a very different life. Very different thighs, certainly.</p><p>Instead, like my two older sisters, Claire and Margaret, I was doomed for people always to describe me by saying, "She's a big girl." Then they always added really quickly "Now, I'm not saying she's fat."</p><p>The implication being that if I was fat, I could at least do something about it.</p><p>"No," they would continue, "she's a fine, big, tall girl. You know, strong."</p><p>I was often described as strong.</p><p>It really pissed me off.</p><p>My boyfriend, Luke, sometimes described me as magnificent. (When the light was behind me and he'd had several beers.) At least that was what he said to me. Then he probably went back to his friends and said, "Now, I'm not saying she's fat. . . "</p><p>The whole drug-addict allegation came about one February morning when I was living in New York.</p><p>It wasn't the first time I felt as if I was on Cosmic Candid Camera. My life was prone to veering out of control and I had long stopped believing that the God who had been assigned to me was a benign old guy with long hair and a beard. He was more like a celestial stand-up comic, and my life was the showcase he used to amuse the other Gods.</p><p>"Wa-atch," he laughingly invites, "as Rachel thinks she's got a new job and that it's safe to hand in her notice on the old. Little does she know that her new firm is just about to go bankrupt!"</p><p>Roars of laughter from all the other gods.</p><p>"Now, wa-atch," he chuckles, "as Rachel hurries to meet her new boyfriend. See how she catches the heel of her shoe in a grating? See how it comes clean off? Little did Rachel know that we had tampered with it. See how she limps the rest of the way?" More sniggers from the assembled gods.</p><p>"But the best bit of all," he laughs, "is that the man she was meeting never turns up! He only asked her out for a bet. Watch as Rachel squirms with embarrassment in the stylish bar. See the looks of pity the other women give her? See how the waiter gives her the extortionate bill for a glass of wine, and best of all, see how Rachel discovers she's left her purse at home?"</p><p>Uncontrollable guffaws.</p><p>The events that led to me being called a drug addict had the same element of celestial farce that the rest of my life had. What happened was, one night I'd sort of overdone it on the enlivening drugs and I couldn't get to sleep. (I hadn't meant to overdo it, I had simply underestimated the quality of the cocaine that I had taken.) I knew I had to get up for work the following morning, so I took a couple of sleeping pills. After about ten minutes, they hadn't worked, so I took a couple more. And still my head was buzzing, so in desperation, thinking of how badly I needed my sleep, thinking of how alert I had to be at work, I took a few more.</p><p>I eventually got to sleep. A lovely deep sleep. So lovely and deep that when the morning came, and my alarm clock went off, I neglected to wake up.</p><p>Brigit, my roommate, knocked on my door, then came into my room and shouted at me, then shook me, then, at her wit's end, slapped me. (I didn't really buy the "wit's end" bit. She must have known that slapping wouldn't wake me, but no one is in good form on a Monday morning.)</p><p>But then Brigit stumbled across a piece of paper that I'd been attempting to write on just before I fell asleep. It was just the usual maudlin, mawkish, self-indulgent poetry-type stuff I often wrote when I was under the influence. Stuff that seemed really profound at the time, where I thought I'd discovered the secret of the universe, but that caused me to blush with shame when I read it in the cold light of day -- the parts that I <i>could</i> read, that is.</p><p>The poem went something like "Mumble, mumble, life..." something indecipherable, "bowl of cherries, mumble, all I get is the pits..." Then -- and I vaguely remembered writing this part -- I thought of a really good title for a poem about a shoplifter who had suddenly discovered her conscience. It was called <i>I can't take anymore.</i></p></p><h2>Ordeal By Ice (Top of the World Trilogy, Book 1)</h2><p><i>Ordeal by Ice</i> is the thrilling account of the great Northern explorers: men who struggled, starved, and finally conquered the capricious forces of the bitter Northern winter in a centuries-long search for the Northwest Passage.

C S Forester&#39;s Hornblower novels have been avidly read for over two generations and are as popular today as when they were first published. They recount stirring adventures in the Royal Navy during the era of the Napoleonic wars and paint a vivid picture of the Senior Service at a time when it grew to dominate the world&#39;s oceans.

Some thirty of these, and over one hundred drawings and marginal decorations, bring to life both the events and characters that appear in the novels. In the second part of the book the author describes how the novels were written, what inspired the adventures and how they relate to the real world of the Royal Navy.</p><p></p><h2>Peking Man Is Missing</h2><p>In the 1920s, on a hill near Peking (now Beijing), a team of scientists discovered a huge cache of human bones, some more than half a million years old. Collectively dubbed ?Peking Man,? they were one of the most important finds in the history of paleontology. And in 1941, in the chaos of World War II they disappeared. No one knows what happened, but there are plenty of theories, many with political implications. Claire Taschdjian?s speculation as to what might have become of the priceless fossils could represent just another theory, but for one intriguing fact: Claire Taschdjian was one of the last people in the world known to have seen Peking Man. (With newly-commissioned material on the true story of the Peking Man.)</p><p>Claire Taschdjian ( 1914 - 1998) was educated in Berlin and later moved to China. In the wake of the Japanese invasion, she married Edgar Taschdjian, an Armenian citizen, in 1937. While in Beijing, Ms. Taschdjian worked as a secretary to the director of the Peking Union Medical College, an American facility funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. It was in her capacity as secretary that she was made responsible for packing up the fossil collection known as Peking Man. <p>After leaving China, Ms. Taschdjian and her husband went to Brooklyn, where they both took positions on the faculty of St. Joseph's College, as professors, respectively, of biology and physics. Claire Taschdjian's writings include two mystery novels (The Peking Man is Missing is one) and numerous scientific papers.</p>- "The fascinating, quick sketches of Western life under Japanese mainland occupation provide exactly the right frame for an elegant puzzle where nothing's belabored and everything fits."<br><br>- "Taking a genuine real-life mystery and creating around it a believable, provocative and totally unpredictable fictional explanation is a neat feat. It has been done before, but not more expertly than here, or more originally...It adds up to a superior mystery story, one that deserves serious consideration for an Edgar."</p><h2>Mayordomo: Chronicle of an Acequia in Northern New Mexico</h2><p><p>Irrigation ditches are the lifelines of agriculture and daily life in rural New Mexico.

She has also written several books of nonfiction. Maso is a professor of Literary Arts at Brown University.Caroline, a novelist and poet, returns from an isolated artists colony to Manhattan, where her widowed, art-historian father has recently died. As one strand of the narrative follows her rediscovery of the city--and of a friend diagnosed with AIDS--another follows the characters she creates in her prose; interspersed throughout are reproductions of pictures and newspaper clippings that inspire her. This narrative cord ruptures with the introduction of "Carole," the persona of Maso, and descriptions of herself at work on the novel while her own beloved friend is dying, Carole/the writer's art incapable of saving him. Despite its trendy structure and themes, this work is steered by anything but a narcissistic postmodernism. Maso ( Ghost Dance ) is not content to muse on the relationship between life and art; she brings to life a "bombardment of images and sounds," fashioning a pattern of astonishing complexity and beauty. The tough-mindedness, originality and wit of her perceptions are intoxicating. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Return</h2><p>THE RETURN Beneath the majestic towers of the Alhambra, Granada&#39;s cobbled streets resonate with music and streets.

She lives in northern Michigan.Grade 7&#x2013;10&#x2014;A story set in Buenos Aires in the late 1970s. Despite its peaceful facade, Argentina is rife with guerrilla warfare and run by malevolent generals. Told in alternating chapters by two teenage siblings, the novel relates how one young person decides to stand up for his political beliefs and ideals and ignores his parent's cautions. Eduardo, in his first year of university, is impatient and intolerant of his father's inaction to protest against the vengeful General Lopez. Silvia, his beautiful younger sister, dances from night to dawn. Her brother's outspoken protests seem little more than another family quarrel. As a visible political activist, Eduardo ends up a target. Only when imprisoned, suffering cruel and calculating psychological torture, does he learn the dangers of what it means to be one of <i>Los Desparecidos</i>. Silvia, awakened to the reality of the situation, does everything in her power to free him. Strategically, she sets herself up as bait for the son of General Lopez, believing that she can win him over and secure her brother's release. The deftly handled voices of Silvia and Eduardo follow the well-intentioned, but often grievous, mistakes of youth. Their compelling tale is a chilling account of the manipulative power of corruption.&#x2014;<i>Alison Follos, North Country School, Lake Placid, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And in those three horrific days of sweltering heat and roaring cannon fire, the outcome was decided not only by acts of courage and strategic decisions but by the character of the players, complex relationships, and pure coincidence. What if a few key factors had gone another way? <br><br>What if Robert E. Lee&#x2019;s brilliant young cavalry commander Jeb Stewart had arrived earlier than the second day of battle? What if Pickett&#x2019;s Charge had been swifter and stronger? What if the Army of the Potomac was commanded by the daring Winfield Hancock instead of the more cautious George Meade? Gettysburg fuses a chaotic clash of arms with a keen vision of how wars are fought and won&#x2013;or lost. Most of all, this is a monumental, blow-by-blow reimagining of one of history&#x2019;s most famous battles&#x2013;the men who shaped it, the events it triggered, and the way it might have been.</p><p>Lt. Col. Peter G. Tsouras, USAR (ret.) is a military historian who recently retired from the Defense Intelligence Agency, where he served as a senior intelligence officer. He also served at the National Ground Intelligence Agency (NGIC) and with the 1st Battalion, 64th Armor, in Germany.

He is married, has three children, and lives in Alexandria, Virginia.CHAPTER 1 <br>July 1, 1863 <br>&#x201c;The Devil&#x2019;s to pay&#x201d;<br><br>Mid-morning, McPherson&#x2019;s Ridge<br><br>They arrived just in time. The 1st Brigade of the 1st Division of I Corps of the Army of the Potomac, the men of the famed Iron Brigade, heard the noise of battle west of Gettysburg and stretched out their marching stride behind the 2nd Brigade to hurry to the fight as the band struck up their war-song, The Girl I Left Behind Me.<br><br>Ahead of them, Brigadier General John Buford&#x2019;s 1st Cavalry Division had played itself out to breaking point holding off the Confederate infantry brigades of Henry Heth&#x2019;s division to the west of the town. All morning Buford had held them, sending messenger after messenger to speed up the arrival of I Corps. Now, as the enemy seemed ready to swamp him, he looked down from his observation point in the steeple of the Lutheran Seminary and saw the dapper Major General John Reynolds ride up with his staff, the long blue columns of I Corps in the not-too-far distance. Buford virtually flew down the steps. Almost teasingly, Reynolds asked, &#x201c;What is the matter, John?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Devil&#x2019;s to pay,&#x201d; he replied.<br><br>There was a quick handshake, and then Reynolds, with Buford behind him, raced up the stairs two at a time. From the steeple it took him only moments to survey the battlefield and make his decision. Reynolds turned to Captain Stephen W. Weld. &#x201c;Ride at once with utmost speed to General Meade. Tell him the enemy are advancing in strong force, and that I fear they will get to the heights beyond the town before I can. I will fight them inch by inch, and if driven into the town, I will barricade the streets and hold them as long as possible.&#x201d;1 Turning to Buford, he added, &#x201c;I hope you can hold on until my corps arrives.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I reckon I can.&#x201d;<br><br>They did not have long to wait. Brigadier James Wadsworth&#x2019;s 1st Division was already passing through Gettysburg. In the lead was Brigadier General Lysander Cutler&#x2019;s 2nd Brigade, coming out of the town onto the Chambersburg or Cashtown Pike. Reynolds had seen the importance of this terrain and had already posted Captain James Hall&#x2019;s Battery B, 2nd Maine Light Artillery, just south of the railroad cut which paralleled the Pike. Reynolds told Hall to &#x201c;damage the artillery to the greatest possible extent, and keep their fire from our infantry until they are deployed.&#x201d;2 Cutler was just arriving when Wadsworth, at Reynolds&#x2019; direction, ordered him to send three of his five regiments north of the railroad cutting and two south of it to support Hall&#x2019;s Battery.<br><br>The 2nd Brigade quickly took up its position on the northern extension of the ridge. The 56th Pennsylvania fired a volley into the 55th North Carolina as soon as it showed itself, the first shots fired by Union infantry in the battle. Two of the 55th&#x2019;s color guard fell. The Carolinians fired in turn, bringing down Cutler and two of his staff.<br><br>The 1st &#x201c;Iron&#x201d; Brigade double-timed onto the field to the left of Cutler&#x2019;s two regiments south of the railroad cut. The band of the 6th Wisconsin changed its tune to The Campbells Are Coming. They were an awesome sight that morning, the 1,900 men of the brigade in their blue dress frock-coats and black Hardee hats turned up on the side and adorned with blue ribbons, an elegant contrast to the fatigue blouse and kepi worn by the rest of the army. But it was not for their appearance that both armies respected them. They had earned their pride of place with iron resolve and a lethal combativeness. They figured that if the army was stretched in a single line they would have the place of<br><br>1 Stephen M.

Few could be found who would disagree. Such was their pride in themselves that when Major General Abner Doubleday exhorted them to fight to the last, they responded: &#x201c;If we can&#x2019;t hold it, where will you find men who can?&#x201d;3<br><br>Now they flowed onto the field, a powerful killing-machine of five veteran western regiments&#x2014;the 2nd and 7th Wisconsin, the 19th Indiana, the 24th Michigan, and the 6th Wisconsin. The gallant Reynolds rode down to post the 2nd Wisconsin, then moved on to the next regiment. He had not been in the line for ten minutes when, turning in the saddle, he fell with a bullet in the back of the head&#x2014;whether from a Confederate sniper or a stray friendly bullet has never been ascertained. The Iron Brigade&#x2019;s commander, Brigadier General Solomon Meredith, pressed on and took his men directly into battle against Brigadier General James Archer&#x2019;s brigade in the woods along Willoughby Run.<br><br>Archer was about to pay the price for his superiors&#x2019; cavalier approach to their orders. Lee had specifically directed that no element of the army was to bring on a battle until the whole army was up. But Archer&#x2019;s division commander, Major General Henry Heth, and the 3rd Corps commander, Lieutenant Gen- eral A.P. Hill, had done just that this morning. Hill&#x2019;s corps was concentrated between Cashtown and Gettysburg when Heth got it into his head that there was a large store of shoes in Gettysburg, sorely needed by his troops. He knew that Early had marched through the town already; how he could have expected even a single pair of shoes to have escaped Early&#x2019;s flinty thoroughness no one knows. The skirmishers of Brigadier General James Pettigrew&#x2019;s brigade had brushed with Buford&#x2019;s cavalry the day before, but so powerful was the lure of shoes that Heth insisted on believing they were only militia, or, at Hill&#x2019;s suggestion, at best a small cavalry detachment of observation. When Heth asked if Hill had any objection to his advancing, the latter had replied airily, &#x201c;None whatsoever.&#x201d; Pettigrew became almost desperate to convince Heth and Hill of the risk, and produced an<br><br>3 The War of the Rebellion, A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies (hereafter cited as OR), vol. XXVII, part I (Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1889) p.244. officer who had served with Hill, Captain Louis Young, to explain that there was more than a detachment of observation in the town, and that they were trained troops, not militia. Young&#x2019;s warnings too were brushed aside. Pettigrew then tried to alert Archer, whose turn it was, in the rotation of brigades, to be first into Gettysburg, but he too was caught up in the mood of optimism. Young commented: &#x201c;This spirit of disbelief had taken such hold that I doubt if any of the commanders of brigades, except General Pettigrew, believed that we were marching into battle, a weakness on their part which rendered them unprepared for what was about to happen.&#x201d;<br><br>At first the fighting was between Archer&#x2019;s light skirmish lines and Buford&#x2019;s pickets, an affair which seemed to confirm to Heth that he faced minimal opposition. By the time he leisurely approached McPherson&#x2019;s Ridge, he found a strong Union battle-line running along Willoughby Run, toward which the skirmishing was drawing his command. At this moment he should have broken off the fight pursuant to Lee&#x2019;s orders. He did not. Instead he deployed the rest of his division from column, a time-consuming evolution that ate up the clock as Reynolds rushed his corps to Buford&#x2019;s aid.<br><br>Archer&#x2019;s Brigade had crossed Willoughby Run and was moving up McPherson&#x2019;s Ridge with Brigadier General Joseph Davis&#x2019; brigade on his left. Almost effortlessly, Buford&#x2019;s cavalry pulled back as Reynolds&#x2019; two infantry brigades took their places. Almost immediately the Confederates felt the difference. The cry went up from Archer&#x2019;s ranks: &#x201c;Here are those damned black-hat fellers gain . . . &#x2019;Taint no militia&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the Army of the Potomac.&#x201d; Both sides fired together at forty yards with deadly impact, and it was here that Reynolds fell. But Meredith was quicker than Archer and outnumbered him three to two as well. He overlapped Archer&#x2019;s right with the 19th Indiana and 24th Michigan. Almost automatically they wrapped themselves around Archer&#x2019;s flank and seared it with enfilade fire. The 2nd and 7th Wisconsin drove the rest of Archer&#x2019;s men down through Willoughby Run and into the woods to the west. Although it was hurt itself, the Iron Brigade had wrecked Archer&#x2019;s Brigade and taken many prisoners, including Archer himself.<br><br>To the north of the railroad cut, Davis&#x2019; Mississippi and North Carolina regiments were severely handling Cutler&#x2019;s men. Flanked by the 55th North Carolina, these three regiments broke and ran back to Seminary Ridge. The Confederates pursued as quickly and soon flanked Hall&#x2019;s Battery, which had to withdraw, leaving one gun behind. In response to a request for help, Double- day sent the 6th Wisconsin forward at a run. It came up on the fence along the Pike and immediately fired into the flank of Davis&#x2019; regiments. Instinctively seeking shelter from this enfilade, the nearest Confederates&#x2014;the 2nd and part of the 42nd Mississippi&#x2014;rushed into the railroad cut. Cutler&#x2019;s other two regiments, the 84th and 95th New York, immediately changed front, and rushed to the fence along the Pike on the left of the 6th Wisconsin. Davis ordered his men out of the cut under the 55th&#x2019;s covering fire, but it was too late. The cut was too deep to fire from, and the Mississippians did not control either approach into it. Their delay was fatal. The 6th&#x2019;s commander, Lieutenant Colonel Rufus R. Dawes, immediately saw the opportunity. Rushing over to the 95th&#x2019;s commander, he shouted, &#x201c;We must charge!&#x201d; The major repli...</p><h2>Call Me Woman</h2><p>autobiography of South African activist</p><p>Bessie Head, one of Africa's best known writers, was born in South Africa but spent much of her life in Botswana.

Her experiences are directly and simply stated in a nonliterary style. In the first section she describes the conditions in Soweto, where she is a community leader. In the second part she traces her own life history in a detailed personal manner. Born into a properous rural home and educated in mission schools, she taught for a number of years. Later, she trained as a social worker and worked with the YWCA. Her experiences in social work and with young people led to her increased community involvement and commitment to change. She was placed under detention in 1977. In the last part of the book she describes her current activities, discusses some of the problems of black women, and tells about the lives of four individual women.

Karen Corsano and Daniel Williman focus especially on his niece and muse, Rose-Marie Ormond, telling her story for the first time. In a score of paintings created between 1906 and 1912, John Singer Sargent documented the idyllic teenage summers of Rose-Marie and his own deepening affection for her serene beauty and good-hearted, candid charm. Rose-Marie married Robert, the only son of Andr� Michel, the foremost art historian of his day, who had known Sargent and reviewed his paintings in the Paris Salons of the 1880s. Robert was a promising historian as well, until the Great War claimed him first as an infantry sergeant, then a victim, in 1914. His widow Rose-Marie served as a nurse in a rehabilitation hospital for blinded French soldiers until she too was killed, crushed under a bombed church vault, in 1918. Sargent expressed his grief, as he expressed all his emotions, on canvas: He painted ruined French churches and, in Gassed, blinded soldiers; he made his last murals for the Boston Public Library a cryptic memorial to Rose-Marie and her beloved Robert. Braiding together the lives and families of Rose-Marie, Robert, and John Sargent, the book spans their many worlds&#x2014;Paris, the Alps, London, the Soissons front, and Boston. Drawing on a rich trove of letters, diaries, and journals, this beautifully illustrated history brings Sargent and his times to vivid life.</p><p>Karen Corsano and Daniel Williman are historians who have collaborated on studies of the Latin archives of the Middle Ages. Now they have turned their attention to a more contemporary subject, whose secrets they have uncovered in archives and eyewitness journals and letters.An indelible account of lives maximally charged with talent and romance, and horribly undone by loss. Karen Corsano and Daniel Williman have produced a brilliant book, a tale of intertwined families that is at once panoramic and intimate. Full of apposite images and quotations from primary sources, it sets out to tell the story of John Singer Sargent&#x2019;s most famous commission&#x2014;the murals for the Boston Public Library&#x2014;but it ends up telling a story that is so much bigger, and even more moving. (Sebastian Smee, Washington Post <i>Washington Post</i>)<br><br>This biography casts new light upon the influences and family history of the famed American portraitist John Singer Sargent (1856&#x2013;1925). Coauthors Corsano and Williman focus intently on two major figures in the artist&#x2019;s life: Rose-Marie Ormand, Sargent&#x2019;s niece and favored model, and her husband, Robert Andr�-Michel, an art historian and the son of a prominent French art critic. Wed in 1913, young Robert and Rose-Marie were 'raised in the cult of the beautiful,' moving in refined circles of artists, scholars, and connoisseurs. Corsano and Williman use the couple&#x2019;s correspondence records to eloquently chart the tragedy that WWI brings to their lives, and to the entirety of the European Belle Epoque. Robert perishes in the trenches as an infantry sergeant in 1917, and Rose-Marie bravely works as an army nurse until she too is killed, by German bombs, in 1918. The authors&#x2019; final chapters reconsider Sargent&#x2019;s postwar work (including the mural masterpiece, Triumph of Religion) as memorial to his beloved family and to the era of beauty and refinement cut short by the Great War. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>This powerful book describes the tragic result of the rush to Armageddon in August 1914 in a way that is not easily forgotten. The subtitle of this evocative book leaves no doubts about the human cost of the war: Painting Love and Loss. (<i>Art Eyewitness</i>)<br><br>Karen Corsano and Daniel Williman have written a gem of a book. Their research here reveals important new biographical discoveries that fill out the historical record on renowned artist John Singer Sargent and his body of work. In addition, the authors provide an intimately nuanced and textured account of select moments and events in the city of Paris and elsewhere during the First World War. This deeply archival and beautifully elaborated story of art and war, of human love and loss, will be of value and substantial interest to art historians and the general reader alike. (Sally M. Promey, Yale University; author of Painting Religion in Public)<br><br>The authors have brilliantly captured a vibrant, artistic, and intellectual Europe on the brink of catastrophic change. They have combined the meticulous research and narrative pace of biography with the lyricism of a love story, which, were it not poignantly real, might seem to be the stuff of fiction. The adventure of Robert&#x2019;s scholarship and the beauty of Rose-Marie (captured in her uncle&#x2019;s ravishing studies) are silent testaments to the glory of their short lives, the tragedy of the Great War that killed them both, and the pity of promise unfulfilled. (Elaine Kilmurray, research director, John Singer Sargent Catalogue Raisonn�)<br><br>Corsano and Williman have created a tapestry of cultural and family connections, illuminating one particularly vibrant corner of the turn-of-the-century world of Sargent and his cosmopolitan friends&#x2014;a world that would not survive the onslaught of war. The authors have focused on a fascinating cast of characters with a moving tale to tell. (Mary McAuliffe)<br><br>Dan Williman and Karen Corsano have told the story of Robert and Rose-Marie Michel for the first time, against the richly textured artistic and intellectual milieu in which they grew up and flourished. . . . The research has been exemplary, the authors delving into French, English, and American archives (public and private) in search of their quarry. Particularly revealing for me is the new material on the Andr� Michel family and their network of relations; the story of Robert&#x2019;s career as a scholar; and the detailing of his military service from his reconstituted notebooks. Rose-Marie&#x2019;s wartime work as a nurse is documented and brought to life, including a rare illustration of her among a group of nurses, leading a line of blinded soldiers. Fascinating discoveries like that abound in a narrative that is at once poignant at the human level and revealing on the wider issues of scholarship, art, and war. (Richard Ormond, coauthor of John Singer Sargent: Complete Paintings (from the foreword))<br><br>John Singer Sargent and His Muse . . . intricately pieces together the stories of Sargent, his niece, and her husband, scholar-turned-soldier Robert Andr�-Michel. . . .

It&#x2019;s a wrenching story about a young couple largely lost to history, whose lives and deaths touched the visions of a great American artist.

Once a lethal assassin for Russia, Natasha Romanov (aka Black Widow) strives to atone for her past mistakes. Working with S.H.I.E.L.D, Natasha is ready to kill her former teacher, Ivan Somodorov, but does not count on rescuing a little girl from a planned explosion at his lab. Without realizing it, Natasha and Ava are caught in Ivan's latest experiment, which gives Ava access to Natasha's abilities. Years later, their lives converge when Ava meets Alex, a boy she has been having dreams about, and is reunited with Natasha, who turns their normal lives upside down.

Only it wasn&#x2019;t a human baby. Buffy Summers paused to listen as she stepped out of the Bronze, Sunnydale&#x2019;s coolest club. Of course, it was Sunnydale&#x2019;s <i>only</i> club, and they let everybody in&#x2014;but it was still cool, somehow.<br> <br>The door opened again, and Xander, her friend, stepped into the dark alley, bumping into her with his gangly body. &#x201c;Hey, Buffy, this is a doorway, not a parking lot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Do you hear that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Xander frowned as he listened to the rock music thumping through the walls. &#x201c;Do you think the band finally hit the right chord?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; Buffy answered. &#x201c;It was something else, like a howl.&#x201d;<br> <br>The door opened again, and Willow stepped out and bumped into them. &#x201c;Are we pretending to be the Three Stooges?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Xander answered. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s when we all try to go through the door at the same time. This is where we stand in the alley and listen to ... What are we listening to?&#x201d;<br> <br>Buffy shook her mane of honey-blond hair. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, just some weird sound&#x2014;like a howl.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure it wasn&#x2019;t the lead singer?&#x201d; Willow asked.<br> <br>Buffy sighed. &#x201c;Okay, so tonight wasn&#x2019;t Lollapalooza at the Bronze. Have you got a better idea where to go?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We could go home and sleep?&#x201d; Willow said hopefully.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s plenty of time to sleep once school starts again,&#x201d; Xander scoffed. &#x201c;Biology, English literature, study hall in the library&#x2014;what could be more restful? But for right now, we&#x2019;ve got to <i>party</i>!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Buffy insisted. &#x201c;The break&#x2019;s almost over, and it&#x2019;s our duty as teenagers to have as much fun as possible before school starts.&#x201d;<br> <br>Willow looked wistful. &#x201c;I think school&#x2019;s more fun than vacation.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why we hang with you,&#x201d; Xander said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re really bizarre.&#x201d;<br> <br>Buffy started walking down the service road that cut between the warehouses around the Bronze. &#x201c;During those desperate times when there&#x2019;s no party anywhere else, I know two guys who never let you down&#x2014;Ben and Jerry! My mom just put in a supply of cookie dough ice cream.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My favorite!&#x201d; Xander exclaimed.<br> <br>With Buffy the Vampire Slayer leading the way, the three friends wandered from the bad part of town, across the tracks, onto a well-lit suburban street. Buffy had to admit that things had been a bit boring lately&#x2014;what with no school plus no vampires to slay&#x2014;but she wasn&#x2019;t going to complain. Vampire vacation was even better than school vacation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; Willow said excitedly. &#x201c;I just heard there&#x2019;s a carnival opening this weekend in the vacant lot on Main Street, where the drive-in movie used to be!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What kind of carnival?&#x201d; Xander asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; Willow said, &#x201c;a cheap, tawdry affair with creaky rides and hokey fun houses.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cool!&#x201d; Xander exclaimed. &#x201c;Just the thing we need to end the break.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And blow all the money we made from babysitting,&#x201d; Buffy added.<br> <br>Enthused about the coming weekend, the three teenagers walked more quickly past the grassy lawns and sedate houses. Except for the way it looked, there was nothing sedate about the town of Sunnydale. It was perched on the Hellmouth, a very special place where the forces of darkness converged and attracted monsters from all over the world. <i>Real</i> monsters.<br> <br>As they walked under a streetlamp, Buffy turned and saw a smudge under Xander&#x2019;s lip. She licked her finger and started to wipe it off. &#x201c;Hold still, Xander, there&#x2019;s chocolate milk shake on your lip.&#x201d;<br> <br>He smiled sheepishly and pushed her hand away. &#x201c;Uh, that&#x2019;s my new mustache and goatee. I&#x2019;ve got that whole Johnny Depp thing going.&#x201d;<br> <br>Willow grinned but quickly covered her mouth. &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s very dashing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Xander beamed proudly. &#x201c;Do you think so?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you want a mustache,&#x201d; Buffy said, &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;d better grow the hair in your nose longer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That stinks,&#x201d; Xander complained, slouching ahead of the girls. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll probably shave it off, but you could let me enjoy it until school starts, okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Buffy said with amusement. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t wig out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Willow frowned puzzledly at her. &#x201c;Why do men want to grow hair on their faces?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re primitive,&#x201d; Buffy said with a shrug. &#x201c;Deep down, under all that deodorant and aftershave, most of them would like to sleep in a cave and pick bugs out of their hairy hides.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But Xander is more refined,&#x201d; Willow said with a hopeful lilt to her voice. &#x201c;He wouldn&#x2019;t really grow a bunch of facial hair, would he? I&#x2019;m scared of things that are <i>too</i> hairy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Buffy twitched as the fine hairs on the back of her neck stood on end&#x2014;they must not have liked Willow&#x2019;s remark. She also felt a slight cramp, reminding her of the next full moon. But she couldn&#x2019;t think about that now, because the hairs on her neck continued their edgy dance.<br> <br>She knew they were in grave danger. <i>But from where? From what?</i> Instinctively she slowed her pace and went into a crouch.<br> <br>Suddenly a pack of wild animals burst from one of the side yards and loped to a stop in front of Xander. With a startled howl, the mustachioed hero sprang backward and scurried toward Buffy. While her friends fell in line behind the Slayer, the pack completed a lazy circle around them. Their actions reminded Buffy of a pack of hyenas she had once encountered at the zoo, but they looked more like dogs.<br> <br>Then the Slayer realized what the predators were&#x2014;<i>coyotes</i>.<br> <br>She had seen coyotes often in the hills around Los Angeles, where she used to live, while horseback riding in Griffith Park or walking near Dodger Stadium. But that was always from a distance&#x2014;she had never seen a pack of coyotes at close quarters, and it was a startling experience.<br> <br>Numbering about fifteen, they were a scrawny, scruffy bunch, with mangy coats and darting eyes. Their tongues hung languidly over long jaws and jagged teeth, and they panted as if they had run a long distance. In their wary eyes, Buffy saw mischief and intelligence. She knew she should stay on her guard, but it was hard to be afraid of them when they looked so much like dogs. <i>Well, maybe dogs that need a bath and a trim. And a decent mud pack</i>, she thought.<br> <br>None of them would meet her gaze except for one&#x2014;an old gray coyote with rheumy yellow eyes. It stopped and stared at her with a wisdom that seemed to be ancient.<br> <br>To cover his initial fright, Xander swaggered toward the scrawny predators. &#x201c;Hey, man, it&#x2019;s just coyotes. Shoo! Go away!&#x201d;<br> <br>Some of the scruffy beasts did back away a few steps, but others bared their long canine teeth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Xander, leave them alone,&#x201d; Buffy ordered, still in her fighting stance. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t start any trouble.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on, they&#x2019;re just coyotes. You&#x2019;re new here, but we see them all the time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Duh,&#x201d; Buffy said testily. &#x201c;I saw coyotes in Los Angeles all the time too. This bunch <i>looks</i> normal, but there&#x2019;s something wiggins about them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Even Willow scoffed at her fear. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s right, Buffy. It&#x2019;s unusual to see them this close, but coyotes come down from the hills this time of year, looking for water.&#x201d;<br> <br>As if on some silent command, the pack of coyotes whirled gracefully on their haunches and loped away. Their joyous, high-pitched yips sounded like a bunch of marauding bandits in an old John Wayne movie. Within seconds, most of them had disappeared around a corner.<br> <br>&#x201c;See, they&#x2019;re chicken!&#x201d; Xander claimed, proudly puffing out his chest. He shouted after the coyotes, &#x201c;Yeah, go on! Get out of here!&#x201d;<br> <br>The old coyote with the weird eyes stopped at the corner to look back at Buffy, and she felt the cramps, the chills, the heaves, and just about every other warning sign her body was capable of producing. The animal didn&#x2019;t look annoyed&#x2014;just curious. Finally it dashed off after its buds, and their eerie yipping continued to pierce the night for many minutes.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re on the hunt,&#x201d; Willow said cheerfully. &#x201c;I did a report on coyotes in zoology, so I know about their habits.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think there&#x2019;s something way bizarre about them?&#x201d; Buffy asked. &#x201c;Apart from the fact that coyotes are bizarre anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Willow answered thoughtfully. &#x201c;But coyotes <i>are</i> strange. Did you know, you can train bears, tigers, elephants, and just about every other creature on earth&#x2014;but not coyotes. In the wild or in captivity, coyotes do their own thing. Native Americans have all kinds of tales about them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re just dumb dogs,&#x201d; Xander said, grinning at Buffy. He put his arm protectively around her shoulders. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Buff. If you&#x2019;re scared of those big bow-wows, I&#x2019;ll protect you.&#x201d;<br> <br>She shook off his gangly arm. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s real Hercules of you, but as long as they stay away from us, we&#x2019;ll have no problem.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Xander is right,&#x201d; Willow said reassuringly. &#x201c;We see them around here a lot. Even though coyotes live all over the West, often near urban areas, it&#x2019;s very rare for them to attack humans.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll remember that.&#x201d; Buffy gave her wispy friend a smile. She didn&#x2019;t want to get mad at Xander and Willow; after all, it wasn&#x2019;t often they got to act more macho than the Slayer. Maybe it was just a pack of especially bold coyotes, new in town, razzing the locals. Still, she couldn&#x2019;t get the aged eyes of that grizzled coyote out of her mind.<br> <br>With her heightened senses, Buffy could still hear the coyotes as they continued their romp through Sunnydale&#x2019;s quiet streets. Their depraved yowls sounded like a combination of tomcats, wolves, and two-year-old toddlers. Buffy was glad when the awful yelps faded into the starlit distance.<br> <br>&#x201c;The children of the night,&#x201d; Xander said in his best Bela Lugosi imitation. &#x201c;What beautiful music they make.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, he always gave me the creeps,&#x201d; Buffy said, &#x201c;because I don&#x2019;t think he knew what he was saying. He, like, learned it phonetically. And why did he walk around with his cape in front of his mouth? Did he have bad breath? All the vampires I know like to have their fangs hanging out, primed and ready.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to pass on ice cream,&#x201d; Willow said with a yawn. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time to go home&#x2014;to dream of returning to school and ending this pointless existence.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s called <i>va-ca-tion</i>,&#x201d; Xander insisted. &#x201c;The absence of work, the natural state of being, the purpose of life.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s boring,&#x201d; Willow said. &#x201c;But maybe it will pick up this weekend.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe it will,&#x201d; Buffy agreed, taking a last took around the quiet suburban neighborhood.<br> <br> � � � <br> <br>Buffy never slept well or deeply anymore, and it didn&#x2019;t take much to jolt her out of bed like a rocket. Still dressed in a clinging sleeveless shirt, she rolled out of bed onto her bare feet and listened to the disturbing sounds coming through her bedroom window. The warm night air brought demented yapping that was unmistakable&#x2014;the coyotes were on the hunt! They were nearby, coming closer.<br> <br>She knew instinctively that it was the same pack of coyotes they had met earlier that night. Although it was now close to four o&#x2019;clock in the morning, they weren&#x2019;t done terrorizing the neighborhood yet. Truthfully, Buffy relished an opportunity to observe the pack without those skeptics, Xander and Willow, slowing her down. She had never seen coyotes that bold, and she wanted to keep an eye on them.<br> <br>Rising like a wave, the eerie yapping passed over her house like an aural ghost. Buffy pulled on a pair of jeans and her tennis shoes, crawled out the window, and scurried down the roof. By the time she jumped to the ground, all she got was a glimpse of the pack as they charged brazenly down the middle of the street. In the lead was a swift blond canine, clutching something white in its mouth.<br> <br>In a frenzy of demented yapping, the others chased it down an alley and were gone a second later. Although she doubted whether she could catch them, Buffy was about to try when she heard a frenzied shout. She turned to see a middle-aged woman in a nightgown bearing down on her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop them! Stop them!&#x201d; the woman screamed. &#x201c;My baby!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your baby!&#x201d; Buffy said with a gasp. Had they really snatched a baby?<br> <br>Panting for breath, the distraught woman rushed up to Buffy and grabbed her arm. &#x201c;They took my Tiger!&#x201d;<br> <br>The teenager blinked at her. &#x201c;Okay, did they take a baby or a tiger? Or was it a baby tiger?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, no, my precious <i>Tiger</i>!&#x201d; the woman shrieked. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a little pug-nosed chow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, a dog,&#x201d; Buffy said, trying not to look relieved. It was terrible that the coyotes had snatched the woman&#x2019;s dog, but that was better than a baby. She remembered similar tragedies in Los Angeles; that&#x2019;s what happened when coyotes went hunting in the suburbs.<br> <br>&#x201c;They took him right out of my backyard!&#x201d; the woman said in a quavering voice. &#x201c;He was old and infirm, and he couldn&#x2019;t fight back. We have to <i>save</i> him!&#x201d;<br> <br>Buffy held her hands and tried to be comforting. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, but I don&#x2019;t see how we&#x2019;re going to save Tiger. He was probably dead within seconds of them grabbing him. Besides, there&#x2019;s no way we could catch them.&#x201d;<br> <br>The distraught woman buried her face in her hands and began to weep, and Buffy glanced around, amazed that nobody else had come out to witness this dramatic scene. Even now, the yelps of the coyotes sounded distant, as if they had only been a passing nightmare.<br> <br>There wasn&#x2019;t much for Buffy to do but walk her home. &#x201c;Where do you live?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we do <i>anything</i>?&#x201d; her neighbor blubbered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, sure, we&#x2019;ll report them to Animal Control, or the dog catcher, or whoever handles stuff like this.&#x201d; Buffy mustered a hopeful smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t do anything,&#x201d; the woman grumbled. &#x201c;Tiger is gone, all thanks to those damn coyotes! It must be Coyote Moon that brought them here. Curse them!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Coyote Moon?&#x201d; Buffy asked warily.<br> <br>The woman stared grimly down the deserted street, which looked so peaceful that it was hard to imagine it had just been the scene of a grisly hunt and kill. &#x201c;Coyote Moon comes in August,&#x201d; she intoned, &#x201c;when it gets hot. It rises red, and it brings the coyotes. That&#x2019;s what my grandmother always said.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Grandmothers are usually right about that stuff,&#x201d; Buffy remarked lamely, thinking of Grandma Summers playing bridge in Clearwater, Florida.<br> <br>The woman began to weep uncontrollably, and the Slayer guided her to the sidewalk. &#x201c;Just point the way home.&#x201d;<br> <br>She only lived half a block away, yet it took about ten minutes to walk her home. Buffy listened sympathetically to lighthearted tales about Tiger&#x2019;s exploits. He was a much-beloved little dog, and he had lived a full, spoiled life. Talking seemed to make the woman feel better, and she thanked Buffy profusely.<br> <br>The teen made sure that her neighbor was safely entrenched behind locked doors before she left her. Although the woman was safe, Tiger was still gone, and nothing would erase the savagery of that attack.<br> <br>As Buffy walked home, the warm wind again brought the eerie sound of coyotes yipping and yowling. She hoped the pack would move on to some other town or go back to the wilderness, but she wasn&#x2019;t counting on it. Unfortunately, when nasty critters got a taste of Sunnydale, they usually made themselves right at home.<br> <br>� 2006 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation.</p><h2>Joel White: Boatbuilder/Designer/Sailor</h2><p><p><strong>A portrait of Joel White, naval architect and builder, sailor and citizen.</strong></p> 70 color photographs, 31 drawings</p><p>Marine historian <strong>Maynard Bray</strong> has provided text for each <em>Calendar of Wooden Boats</em>�, as well as for six books featuring Benjamin Mendlowitz&#x2019;s boat photography.

She lives in Massachusetts with her husband.In Page's unengaging second novel ( The Body in the Belfry ) Faith Fairchild spends an August vacation on Sanpere Island, Maine, with her two-year-old son while her minister husband goes on a religious retreat. At an auction, Faith buys a quilt made by recently deceased Matilda Prescott, who bequeathed her Victorian mansion to two off-islanders, much to the distress of locals who believe rumors that a treasure of gold is hidden there. Walking on the beach, Faith finds the body of one of the house's new owners; another murder follows and Faith's house is ransacked. She then guesses that the killer is looking for the quilt whose pattern of boxes and squares may form a map to the gold. No active sleuth, Faith lets circumstances involve her. She is not a believable heroine, and although we are told that she and Tom, who joins her before the resolution, are a loving couple, their interaction is frequently contentious.

A. Henty)</h2><p>Facing Death is a story with a purpose. It is intended to show that a lad who makes up his mind firmly and resolutely that he will rise in life, and who is prepared to face toil and ridicule and hardship to carry out his determination, is sure to succeed. The hero of the story is a typical British boy who, dogged, earnest, generous, and though &#x201c;shamefaced&#x201d; to a degree, is ready to face death in the discharge of duty. <p>Date: Victorian era <br> Location: Wales <br> Main topic: Life in a Welsh mining village</p></p><p>G. A. Henty's life was filled with exciting adventure. After completing his work at Westminster School, he attended Cambridge University, where he undertook a rigorous course of study and also enjoyed boxing, wrestling, and rowing. The strenuous study and healthy, competitive participation in sports prepared Henty for his adventures. To name just a few, he fought with the British army in the Crimea, served as a war correspondent during Garibaldi's fight for independence in Italy, visited Abyssinia, witnessed the Franco-Prussian war while in Paris, observed the Carlists in Spain, attended the opening of the Suez Canal, toured India with the Prince of Wales (later Edward II), and visited the California gold fields. <p>G. A. Henty lived during the reign of Queen Victoria (1837-1901) and began his story-telling career with his own children. After dinner it was his custom to spend an hour or two telling them a story that often continued for days. In fact, some stories lasted for weeks! One evening a friend happened to be present during Henty's "story hour." Watching the children as they sat spell-bound, he urged Henty to write down his stories so others could enjoy them. Happily for us, Henty did so. One of his secretaries reported that he often would pace rapidly back and forth in his study dictating stories as fast as the secretary could record them. He became known to his readers as "The Prince of Story-Tellers" and "The Boys Own Historian." Henty's stories revolve around a fictional boy hero during fascinating periods of history. His heroes are diligent, courageous, intelligent, and dedicated to their country and cause in the face of, at times, great peril. Respected historians have acknowledged his histories, particularly the accounts of battles, for their accuracy. His ability to bring his readers action-packed adventure in an accurate historical setting makes the study of history exciting, and removes the drudgery often associated with such study.</p></p><h2>California Native American Tribes Yurok Tribe: 11 (California&#39;s Native American Tribes)</h2><p>Boule, Mary</p><p></p><h2>The Five Minute Hair Stylist</h2><p>Combine the success of the "five-minute" format with the enormous popularity of <b>Beautiful Braids</b> and the result is this appealing collection of 30 simple, pretty, and sophisticated hairstyles that any woman can create with ease and confidence. <b>125 full-color photographs.</b></p><p></p><h2>Memphis Belle</h2><p>Very good in lightly chipped dustjacket, first edition,limited and numbered, this being number 332, signed by the author and margaret Polk who the belle was named after, inscribed</p><p></p><h2>Are You There, Bear?</h2><p>Looking with a flashlight for his teddy bear in a darkened room, a young child learns that his other toys look much like a teddy bear in the dark</p><p></p><h2>Secrets of the Sea</h2><p><b><i>A stunning look at some of the most extraordinary and rarely seen creatures from under the sea</i></b><br><br>This book takes you on a journey to discover an incredible and rarely seen world.

In an old American tradition, Raskin wants to return power to the grass roots, trust to the international arena, and the ideal of a common good to the American consciousness. Honorable sentiments, but the book is torn by tension. We must go back to the people, but we must also lead them. We see the idea of a rational and "natural" international law accepted but the "Platonism" that usually goes with it rejected. Raskin believes that such tension can be dissolved through education, which will eventually lead most people to see that the communitarianism he espouses is correct. But may not some people, even educated, still want a Ronald Reagan?

You may be someone who does not believe in healing. For most of his life, author Phil Goldfedder, a Jewish neurosurgeon, did not believe in healing either. In fact, for most of his life he did not even believe in Jesus. When he was miraculously healed of chronic intractable pain, however, his whole belief system underwent an exciting and radical transformation. Now Dr. Goldfedder knows that Jesus is the Great Physician who can heal you everywhere you hurt, no matter what the condition may be. This user-friendly book was written under the guidance of the Holy Spirit to provide comfort and hope to all those who are seeking a healing of any kind. Its uplifting truths will help you to believe for your healing even before you see it. There is really only one prerequisite before reading this book-a strong desire to be healed and to be released from the suffering your illness has caused without regard to any traditional denominational beliefs, long-held ideas or philosophies you may have, or any scientific principles that deny the possibility of healing. As you read, you will learn how to blend the power of God&#39;s Word (the Holy Bible) with faith, trust, hope, and belief that will help you to understand truly that Healing Is Yours. God&#39;s love for you is steadfast, and He wants you to walk in health and happiness.</p><p>Phillip Goldfedder&#39;s education includes a B.A. from Central High School in Philadelphia, PA, a B.S. from Albright College in Reading, PA and an M.D. from New York Medical College, followed by a rotating internship in Reading, PA. His five-year neurosurgical residency was at Episcopal Hospital in Philadelphia, PA. Throughout his medical practice, he came to realize that &#34;there was an unanticipated disappointment when patients often failed to respond to the teachings of conventional and traditional medical treatments.&#34; He &#34;risked&#34; a visit to a Christian church, and as a result of being healed from chronic, intractable pain, he decided to pursue an intensive study of the Bible and the teachings of Jesus. He has received a Doctorate in Christian Education from Canyonville Christian Academy and is an ordained minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. He and his wife, Maureen, and their five beagles, currently reside in Edison, NJ. The author would be delighted to hear what God has done for you as a result of reading Healing Is Yours.

The dynamic behind the language can still mean renewal for theology and church today, but only if that legal metaphor is not left to stand alone. Gerhard Forde calls for a recovery of Paul&#39;s equally vital metaphor of death-resurrection, which speaks of our dying to the old and being raised to new life in Christ. Justification, he contends, is death and rising, and where these complementary metaphors are allowed to interpret one another the Gospel can once again explode with all its original power. This fresh appropriation of the confessional witness contributes not only to an enhanced understanding of Reformation teachings, but also to an ecumenical dialogue that is zeroing in more closely on the catholic provenance and current vitality of the Augsburg Confession.</p><p>Gerhard O. Forde was Professor of Systematic Theology at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota.</p><h2>The Three Little Pigs: An Old Story (Sunburst Book)</h2><p><p>This much beloved story has inspired a visual interpretation that has the look of a classic.</p></p><p><p><b>Margot Zemach</b> (1931-89) was born in Los Angeles, California. She began illustrating stories by her husband, Harve, in 1959, and their subsequent collaborations led to many enduring children's books, including<i> The Judge: An Untrue Tale, a Caldecott Honor Book; A Penny a Look</i>, an ALA Notable Book; and <i>Duffy and the Devil</i>, recipient of the Caldecott Medal.</p>PreSchool-Grade 2--The Three Little Pigs joins the gallery of newly-illustrated folk and fairy tales that have glutted the market in recent years. At least this version is refined. True to her style, Zemach uses distinctive wispy watercolor strokes to illustrate the story. In this version, the pigs get eaten and stay that way; and after the wolf tries to trick the third pig (with turnips, apples, and the fair), he is cooked in a pot of soup. The characters sport old-fashioned garb, with the pigs in tattered clothes and the wolf in a tailored jacket and top hat. Some of Zemach's interpretations are practical, interesting, and ironic: the wolf has his coat off, draped on his arm, just before he's going to lunge down the chimney. The jump itself is shown in a progressive motion to show the force of the leap. And the final page shows the surviving pig smiling, having his soup, surrounded by a bowl of apples, a basket of turnips, and a souvenir of the wolf--his tail in the pot. An additional item for collections in which another version of this tale is needed. --Marianne Pilla, formerly at Long Beach Public Library, N.Y.<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Breath of Suspension</h2><p>A collection of ten stories creates a realm of ""irrelevant miracles,"" where civilization-building is a pastime and death is an art, and offers unique interpretations of fear, love, guilt, greed, obligation, and obsession. Reprint. <i>K. NYT. PW. </i></p><p>"Darkly suave competence" is how The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction refers to Jablokov's first novel, <b>Carve the Sky</b>, and the phrase could easily apply to many of the stories in this, Jablokov's first short story collection. Ranging from time travel to artificial intelligence, Jablokov covers a lot of ground in the ten stories here, although readers will quickly notice recurring themes both of art and self-identity amidst colorful, retro-decadent future worlds. Although his technique and consistency vary, Jablokov shows with his powerful, dynamic prose that he's a writer worth watching.These 10 short stories by Jablokov ( Carve the Sky ) won't be new to most SF devotees, since versions of each have appeared in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine over the past nine years. But reading them together is an exciting experience. Tales of widely differing lengths address various alternative near futures. All share a reverence for myth and remembrance, from the title story, about an ancient and ambivalent monk whose patron saint is the never-dying astronaut blasting away from Earth at light speed, to the tale of a lunatic dolphin messiah "swimming" through the atmosphere of Jupiter ("A Deeper Sea"). A 20th-century mathematician in the early stages of Alzheimer's imprints his personality, with its moral qualms and aesthetic indulgences, on a computer so that it may remember his values and survive his dissolution ("Living Will"). In a comic vein, interstellar time-travelers track down "Religion Pushers" by jaunting through the centuries in pursuit of an Artifact Junkie ("Many Mansions"). And in yet another universe, trench warfare continues in France for much of the 20th century as soldiers refuse to give up combat ("Beneath the Shadow of Her Smile"). Jablokov's canvas is broad, but through it all there runs a tint of lyricism and a regard for mind and spirit that could extend the collection's appeal. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Charlie&#39;s monument: An allegory of love</h2><p>Charlie was born with only one arm, a twisted back, and badly deformed legs.

It arrived not in the form of a natural disaster, but with a twenty-five-year-old preacher, George Whitefield. He had come to the New World to tell his listeners to repent their sins and be reborn in Christ, to reject the dead teachings of their unredeemed ministers, and to support his many holy endeavors.</p><p>It worked: his stunning oratory and colorful theatrics gave him an almost ungodly sense of power over his audience. Overwhelmed with passion, his listeners experienced uplift and ecstasy in their quest for salvation. They also felt a great deal of fear, as his message divided congregations and split Americans into warring sides over God. Eventually, this spiritual uprising would acquire a new name&#x2015;the Great Awakening&#x2015;and it would alter the very fabric of&nbsp;American life&nbsp;in ways no one could have ever expected.</p><p>Whitefield's methods inspired allies and imitators who drove the movement to greater heights&#x2015;men like Gilbert Tennent, who issued threats against his enemies and imagined hell for those who disagreed with him, and Jonathan Edwards, a thoughtful theologian who nonetheless preached one of the most frightening sermons in history. Ben Franklin, too, played a key role in promoting and profiting by the Awakening, even as he was repelled by certain aspects of it. At the same time, radical new preachers rose up to inspire women and enslaved black Americans to offer their own testimony to God in ways that proved to be threatening to the colonial hierarchy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Great Awakening peaked and then collapsed, but it had a profound impact in reshaping the American mind. The voices of dissent left the churches and went into the streets, and aimed their rancor at a new target: the ruling power of Great Britain. And so what began as a revolution fought over words and gospel mutated into one fought with riots and violence, until it eventually exploded in to war.</p><p>This book tells the story of that transformation, and the way a firebrand English preacher incited Americans to rebel against more than a century of tradition, and set a precedent for the kind of galvanizing agitator who is still with us today&#x2015;the American Demagogue. Though almost three centuries have passed, the themes remain the same&#x2015;anger, grievance, dissension, self-promotion, and social turmoil&#x2015;as the tide of populism continues to rise and fall.&nbsp;</p> 8 pages of B&amp;W photographs</p><p><strong>J.D.

The road to becoming an underground- comics legend begins with Komisky-Crumb as a nice jewish girl from Long Island, carries her to Greenwich Village in the 1960&#39;s, and to California, land of hippy cartoonists, and on to a more or less sedate life with hubby(equally legendary R. Crumb) and daughter, Sophie. Her funny/sad tales show a woman bewildered by her place in society and determined to find her own way. These stories touch on every phase of her existence from childhood, to sexual obsessions, food, motherhood and, of course, her art. The book includes sharp vignettes of the Movers and Shakers - and the jerks - of the art and music worlds since the sixties.</p><p>Best known as underground comics doyen R. Crumb's wife, Kominsky Crumb is a prolific and trailblazing comics autobiographer. In this freewheeling memoir, she chronicles a peripatetic life, starting with the step from a 1950s Long Island childhood to hippie days on the Lower East Side and in San Francisco, where she fell in with the nascent underground comics scene and met Crumb. Disillusioned with America in the early 1990s, the couple emigrated to the south of France, where they now live in a medieval chateau. Kominsky Crumb juxtaposes prose reminiscences with autobiographical strips from the periods under discussion, and besides her solo comics efforts, collaborative comics "jams" with her husband, some of her paintings, photographs of friends and family, and memorabilia appear. Although her raw, messy drawing style and no-holds-barred content are off-putting to many comics fans, there is no denying the potency of her confessional comics. Readers drawn to this volume to learn more about Crumb are likely to come away from it with a newfound appreciation of his talented spouse. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Even the imperial legions, long inured to the bloodshed, yearn for some respite. Yet the Empress&#x20ac;&#x2122; rule remains absolute, enforced by her dread Claw assassins.For Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his cynical squad of Bridgeburners, and for Tattersail, sole surviving sorceress of the Second Legion, the aftermath of the siege of Pale should have been a time to heal the still living and mourn the manydead. The Empress has other ideas. However, it would appear the Empire is not the only player in this great game. A more sinister, shadowbound force is poised to make its first move.Conceived and written on an epic scale, Gardens of the Moon is a breathtaking achievement &#x20ac;&#x201d;</p><p>"Give me the evocation of a rich, complex and yet ultimately unknowable other world, with a compelling suggestion of intricate history and mythology and lore. Give me mystery amid the grand narrative. Give me a world in which every sea hides a crumbled Atlantis, every ruin has a tale to tell, every mattock blade is a silent legacy of struggles unknown. Give me, in other words, the fantasy work of Steven Erikson. Erikson is a master of lost and forgotten epochs, a weaver of ancient epics on a scale that would approach absurdity if it wasn't so much fun."--Andrew Leonard, Salon.com <br>"Steven Erikson is an extraordinary writer. My advice to anyone who might listen to me: Treat yourself to Gardens of the Moon. And my entirely selfish advice to Steven Erikson: Write faster."-Stephen R. Donaldson <br> "The author is working so far beyond genre convention you need to measure the distance in light years. We'd sooner attempt to reduce the history of China to a logline than try a plot synopsis in this limited space. Enter Malazan and find a fully-realized universe complete with history, mythology, sociology, and thaumatology. It is peopled with characters who are neither black nor white but patterned of gritty grey and shadows and wade through oceans of blood. There's nothing safe about fantasy like this: intriguing, complex, thought provoking, exceedingly well-written, and, for the intelligent reader, exhilaratingly satisfying."--Paula Guran, Cinemafantastique <br>"An astounding debut...has the potential to become a defining work."--SF Site <br>"Gripping, fast-moving, delightfully dark, with a masterful and unapologetic brutality reminiscent of George R.

Utterly engrossing."--Elizabeth Haydon <br>"The experience of reading Gardens of the Moon is akin to being plunged into a full-immersion course in a heretofore undiscovered realm. Erikson's world is richly envisioned, dense and gritty, rife with magic and filled with complex political and military intrigue."--Jacqueline Carey <br>"A brilliant book! Exciting, inventive, intelligent--frequently funny. A wonderful book to read and to recommend to others."--David Drake <br>"I stand slack-jawed in awe of The Malazan Book of the Fallen. This masterwork of imagination may be the high water mark of epic fantasy---accomplished with none of the customary rifs on Tolkien. This marathon of ambition has a depth and breadth and sense of vast reaches of inimical time unlike anything else available today. The Black Company, Zelazny's Amber, Vance's Dying Earth, and other mighty drumbeats are but foreshadowings of this dark dragon's hoard."--Glen Cook <br>"Complex, challenging...Erikson's strengths are his grown-up characters and his ability to create a world every bit as intricate and messy as our own."--J. V. Jones, SFX <br>Praise for Gardens of the Moon:<br>"Steven Erikson is an extraordinary writer. I read Gardens of the Moon with great pleasure. And now that I have read it, I would be hard pressed to decide what I enjoyed more: the richly and ominously magical world of Malaz and Genabackis; the large cast of sympathetically-rendered characters; or the way the story accumulates to a climax that hits like machinegun fire.

Strong females smack of the unfeminine. They have been called wicked, wanton, and willful. Sometimes that is a just designation, but just as often it is not. "Well-behaved women seldom make history," is the frequently quoted statement by historian and feminist Laurel Thatcher Ulrich. But what makes these misbehaving women "bad"? Are we idolizing the wicked or salvaging the strong?<br><br>In BAD GIRLS, readers meet twenty-six of history&#x2019;s most notorious women, each with a rotten reputation. But authors Jane Yolen and Heidi Stemple remind us that there are two sides to every story. Was Delilah a harlot or hero? Was Catherine the Great a great ruler, or just plain ruthless? At the end of each chapter, Yolen and Stemple appear as themselves in comic panels as they debate each girl&#x2019;s badness&#x2014;Heidi as the prosecution, Jane for context.<br><br>This unique and sassy examination of famed, female historical figures will engage readers with its unusual presentation of the subject matter. Heidi and Jane&#x2019;s strong arguments for the innocence and guilt of each bad girl promotes the practice of critical thinking as well as the idea that history is subjective. Rebecca Guay&#x2019;s detailed illustrations provide a rich, stylized portrait of each woman, while the inclusion of comic panels will resonate with fans of graphic novels.</p><p>Jane Yolen is the award-winning author of nearly three hundred children's books, including SEA QUEENS; LAST LAUGHS; SNOW, SNOW: WINTER POEMS (Boyds Mills), and THE ROGUES (Philomel). She has been called the Hans Christian Andersen of the Americas. Jane lives in Western Massachusetts and Scotland. Heidi E. Y. Stemple is the author of more than a dozen children&#x2019;s books, several co-authored with her mother, Jane Yolen. Recent titles include PRETTY PRINCESS PIG and NOT ALL PRINCESSES DRESS IN PINK. Heidi lives in western Massachusetts.*Starred Review* Girls gone wild! The mother-daughter team of Yolen and Stemple have rounded up some of the meanest (or perhaps just misguided) group of gals history has known. And they have wrapped them in an attractive package that makes reading about their exploits even more enjoyable. The list begins with the biblical Delilah (sorry, Sampson), introduces Cleopatra, stops in England to say hello to Anne Boleyn and (bloody) Queen Mary, and then heads over to America to visit with Tituba, Calamity Jane, and Typhoid Mary. And that&#x2019;s just a few of the 26 spies, sirens, and female felons the duo takes on. Each subject gets a jauntily written page or so, prefaced by one of illustrator Guay&#x2019;s terrific full-page portraits and back-ended with a comic book&#x2013;style page featuring the authors discussing whether the woman was exactly what she seemed. In fact, both an introduction and afterword focus on how history changes its opinion on people&#x2019;s actions, the way history&#x2019;s winners get the glory, and whether circumstances shape events more than personalities do. The thick paper, graphic novel&#x2013;style typeface, and delightful artwork executed in ink and brush and dabbed with digital color will draw readers. The bibliography will lead kids to more about these gals.

Although she and her husband William J. Bailey arrived in the mid-1830s and worked beside well-known historic figures as Jason Lee and John McLoughlin, today few know of the Baileys. Why? Their story is explosive. <br><br>In 1835, William arrived at the Methodist Mission with a long tomahawk gash in his face and later would avenge the attack; in 1837, Margaret was among the first seven white women to arrive by ship from eastern United States, and she quickly made enemies of the missionaries and friends of the Kalapuyan Tribe. Their story presents surprising views of historical figures and events from a perspective not usually seen. <br><br>Although the dialogue and one fictional family are creations of the author RC Marlen, events in this exciting novel were written to show the accurate history of Oregon Country, 1835-1854.</p><p></p><h2>EastEnders 20th Anniversary</h2><p>EastEnders is the ongoing saga of life in London&#x2019;s East End.

Reprint.</p><p>Ellen Datlow (www.datlow.com) has been editing short fiction for over thirty years. In that time, she has edited more than fifty science fiction, fantasy, and horror anthologies for adults, teenagers, and children, many of them with Terri Windling. She has received scores of awards for individual books and her body of work. Ellen lives and works in New York City.In her introduction to this volume, master anthologist Datlow (Blood is Not Enough) observes that science fiction "has traditionally been a bit hesitant about dealing with sexual and gender themes," but this collection of 20 short stories gives it a try and often succeeds in evoking the "alienness" of all sexual relationships. The best stories rely not upon interstellar orgies or futuristic sex toys but upon the sexual foibles of human beings on 20th-century Earth. "Oral," by Richard Christian Matheson, concerns a man who interacts with the physical world only through somebody else's description, and the woman who tries to provide that description. Matheson takes everyday, neutral objects like wine glasses and sea shells and infuses them with a sensuality that makes them seem alien and fantastic. In Bruce McAllister's present-day "Captain China," a young boy forced into prostitution faces a bleak reality that has timely and disturbing overtones. Of the more traditional SF stories, Neil Gaiman's darkly humorous poem/screenplay, "Eaten," features a PI whose search for a missing woman leads him literally to hell, while Simon Ings's "Grand Prix" is an action-filled account of a man who can neurally link himself to his race car. A few stories lose themselves in an attempt to be different?like "Sextraterrestrials," an eccentric but boring record of an E-mail poetry competition between Joe Haldeman and Jane Yolen. Overall, however, this is provocative reading not just for SF fans but for all those who sometimes feel that the opposite sex is just too strange to be from the same planet. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Guardians of Ga&#39;hoole Boxed Set, Books 1-4</h2><p>Finally, the books that started the best-selling Guardians of Ga'Hoole adventure story, Book 1:The Capture, Book 2:The Journey, and Book 3:The Reacue, all in one boxed set.<br><br>Deep in the Forest of Tyto the adventure takes wing!<br>Soren is born in a forest kingdom where Barn Owls have lived in peace for eons.

Her father was curate of Haworth, Yorkshire and her mother died when she was five years old, leaving five daughters and one son. In 1824 Charlotte, Maria, Elizabeth, and Emily were sent to Cowan Bridge, a school for clergymen's daughters, where Maria and Elizabeth both caught tuberculosis and died. The children were taught at home from this point on and together they created vivid fantasy worlds which they explored in their writing. Charlotte worked as a teacher from 1835 to 1838 and then as a governess. In 1846, along with Emily and Anne, Charlotte published Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell.After this Emily wrote <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, Anne wrote <i>Agnes Grey</i> and Charlotte wrote <i>The Professor</i>. <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Agnes Grey</i> were both published but Charlotte's novel was initially rejected. In 1847 <i>Jane Eyre</i> became her first published novel and met with immediate success. Between 1848 and 1849 Charlotte lost her remaining siblings: Emily, Branwell and Anne. She published <i>Shirley</i> in 1849, <i>Villette</i> in 1853 and in 1854 she married the Revd. Arthur Bell Nicholls. She died the next year, on March 31, 1855.&#x201c;I am only just returned to a sense of the real world about me, for I have been reading Villette . . .

Here he campaigns for a recovery of a rich understanding of the virtue of prudence, and for its application by policymakers and citizens to contemporary public policy. As Forsythe explains, prudence, in its classical sense, is the ability to apply wisdom to right action. In this book he explores the importance of applying the principles of prudence--taking account of limitations in a world of constraints and striving to achieve the greatest measure of justice under current circumstances--to the realm of politics, especially that of bioethics. In particular, Forsythe applies these concepts to the ongoing debate among pro-life advocates regarding gradual versus radical change as the most effective way to achieve political and legislative goals. Drawing on the Bible, philosophy, and the wisdom of historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln and William Wilberforce, he makes a strong case for a strategy of seeking to achieve the maximal change possible at a given time--or political prudence. As such, it has broad implications for political scientists and strategists both within and beyond the pro-life context.</p><p>Clarke D. Forsythe (J. D. Valparaiso University; M.A., bioethics, Trinity International University) is a leading policy strategist in bioethical issues and senior counsel for Americans United for Life, a national pro-life public policy organization. He has argued cases before federal and state courts and has testified before Congress. He has published more than fifteen law review articles and book chapters on bioethics and the law. He has taught classes at Wheaton College, Trinity International University, and other colleges and universities, as well as spoken to audiences at Marquette University, Notre Dame Law School, Valparaiso University School of Law and Ave Maria School of Law."Clarke Forsythe has written an incisive, admirably balanced analysis of the situation in which Christians now find themselves in the public square. It should serve as an authoritative guide for a long time." (James Hitchcock, professor of history, St. Louis University)<br><br>"Clarke Forsythe's <em>Politics for the Greatest Good</em> is an invaluable contribution to reflection within the pro-life movement on the best strategy to adopt in vindicating the right to life. He grounds his analysis on important historical materials, both from early American political thought and from the career of William Wilberforce, in making his case for an incremental strategy to reverse <em>Roe v. Wade.</em> He also provides effective critical analysis of the misguided argument that political morality requires never voting for laws that expand protection of the unborn but do not prohibit all abortions (for the time being), due to the lack of the necessary political support for broader protection. As a longtime leader in the pro-life movement who has done so much to craft and defend legal and legislative strategies to protect the right to life, he is intimately familiar with the often difficult circumstances facing those who would reestablish an American commitment to protecting all innocent human life from conception to natural death. Christians involved in pro-life work should be thankful for, and attentive to, his astute analysis and advice." (Christopher Wolfe, codirector, Ralph McInerny Center, and Emeritus Professor, Marquette University)<br><br>"While we eagerly await the promised kingdom of God, here on earth we strive for the better that is far short of the best. This book is both a guide and an encouragement for faithful strivers." (The late Richard John Neuhaus, editor-in-chief, First Things)<br><br>"Prudence, especially in the context of politics and the struggle for social reform, is a poorly understood, largely neglected and desperately needed virtue. We have long needed an intellectually coherent and compelling treatment of the subject. Happily, Clarke Forsythe has met the need. Drawing on the wisdom of Aristotle, Wilberforce, Lincoln, and other theorists and practitioners of political prudence, Forsythe has written a book that will both instruct and inspire all who work to protect the weak and vulnerable and to advance the cause of justice."

Several doctors said his only hope of walking again was to fuse some of the vertebrae in an operation that would leave him with a lifetime of pain and limited mobility.</p> <p>But as a chiropractor, Dispenza knew enough about spinal health and his own post-accident physical state to take a remarkable risk: he refused the operation and, along with a careful therapeutic program, literally <em>thought</em> his way to healing. Nine months later, he was able to walk and function as well as he had before the accident, and he credits a large amount of that recovery to the power of his own mind.</p> <p>This incredible experience spurred Joe on to learn about this most important tool that we all possess&#x2014;the brain&#x2014;and he passes that potent knowledge on to you. He explores how the brain learns, how it processes information, and, when it isn't stimulated enough by new experiences, how it can become addicted to comfortable, familiar patterns.</p> <p>Every time we think a thought or feel an emotion, the brain sends chemicals throughout the body that reproduce that feeling, often giving us a physical reaction.

The morning's clouds had long since streamed out to sea, leaving blue sky and four inches of new, wet snow blanketing all of Plymouth. The horses cast vaporous balloons to the air and flung up their heads as if intoxicated by the change in weather. Of the storm, only an ashen streak remained on the horizon, lying over the water like a bitter dream. That and the combers breaking in chalky ribbons against the wharf pilings. I let the curtain fall and turned in time to see Sophia bolt past my door in her chemise, dark hair flying."Sophia!" Fourteen, nearly grown, yet still wild as a colt, my niece was as much a trial to my sister, Lucy, as I'd been to our mother. With her long,sharp nose and gray eyes, she even resembled me. "Sophia, what sort of behavior is this?" I crossed to the doorway and regarded her with elaborate solemnity, though I had to master a smile to do so.Sophia stopped beneath the portrait of my father, which had hung in the same spot since it was painted ten years before his death. Her cheeks were a frenzy of red splotches. She dipped her chin and brought her index fingers together at her waist in a posture that she likely hoped I'd perceive as properly demure."Aunt Lydia?" She smiled up at me through long lashes. Practicing, no doubt. Before long, some young man would be the recipient of that look.I glanced at my father's likeness, to derive strength from the stern line of his mouth, his judging gaze. "If you expect to attend Mr. Emerson's lecture this afternoon, you must comport yourself as a lady," I said. "You are not a wild animal."Sophia bowed her head, yet I caught the pucker of agitation--of mischief even--upon her young brow.I stepped into the hall and said after her, "Ladies do not run down hallways half-dressed. Ladies walk with elegance and grace. Even when they're in a hurry.""Yes, Aunt Lydia.""Show me."Sophia closed her eyes and took four prim steps."No, no. That's not it at all. Look." I walked the length of the hall. My hem sighed over the carpet, my arms swung quietly against my skirts. I knew how it looked--it was plain in Sophia's admiring glance--I was gliding rather than walking. It appeared as if my slippers never touched the floor. It was an effect I'd spent years perfecting. I turned and walked back to her."Now you. Lengthen your neck--feel it stretch--and let your body hang from your shoulders. Look, imagine it as a bolt of fabric draped across your bones.""My <i>bones</i>?" My niece made a face."Your flesh is a kind of fabric, is it not?" I adjusted my sleeves at the wrist, and saw that a thread had come loose and the hem must soon be mended, a task I did not relish. "It ought to be cared for and worn with grace," I said. "Now you show me you've learned what I taught."Droplets of perspiration had dampened the tiny curls in front of her ears. I touched one and it wound instantly around my finger. "Show me," I said,dropping my hand to her shoulder and turning her so that I could observe her back as she walked obediently to the head of the stairs, where she turned and came back to me.I nodded. "Much better. You must practice every day. Do you still stand in the dancing stocks?""Sometimes.""Every day, Sophia. For thirty minutes every day."She nodded again but would not look at me and I knew her habits would not change. The only thing that could make a girl stand in the stocks was a lively and determined will."Surely you won't forbid me the lecture?" Her voice was anxious, ready to plummet toward despair should I deny her. "All Plymouth will be there! Everyone I know is going!""We do not attend lectures that we might be <i>seen,</i> Sophia," I admonished. "We go to <i>hear.</i> I've heard Mr. Emerson speak and I know he's a man of wisdom and intellect. His ideas are forward-thinking, and it behooves us to hear and understand them. But it is not a fashion show." My ears caught the scolding tone of my father's voice in mine, and I stopped. Hadn't I sworn that I would never speak to a child that way? Hadn't I cringed every time my father had bridled me with his hard tongue?Sophia bent her head again in a posture of penitent resignation, yet I saw that her toes were nearly dancing upon the floor, as if she could not control their expectancy.I instantly relented, for she reminded me so much of myself. "You may attend as long as you behave like a lady," I said. "Now go and get dressed. We must be at the meetinghouse in an hour."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I HAD CHOSEN my gray silk for the occasion, and had already laid it out on the bed. Though Lucy declared it out of fashion, with its pleated bodice and plain collar, it suited my taste as well as my principles. I'd long since abandoned interest in the whims of society, and settled on a simple and comfortable style without corsets or stays. I regarded simplicity as a virtue, one that encouraged clarity of thought and action.I took the pins from my hair and let it fall in heavy brown waves to my knees. Even at the age of thirty-three, I enjoyed letting it down, for it never failed to make me feel girlish and unencumbered. As I combed my hair, mygaze drifted around the room, lingering on my bookshelf. Goethe was my current favorite; the cover was already worn from the many times I'd read it since summer, when George Bradford gave it to me in appreciation for my contributions to his philosophy class. I had also read extensively in Swedenborg, the French philosopher on whose work Mr. Emerson was scheduled to speak that afternoon. I was eager to hear what he would say. My aunt Priscilla had lately charged me with Swedenborgian leanings, though I'd retorted smartly that I would never fall under the influence of any one philosopher.When I heard Mr. Emerson in Boston, I knew he was as great a philosopher as any I'd read. Yet it was not merely his thoughts that impressed me, but his mannerisms, which suggested a distinctive refinement education alone could not produce. He did not move his hands and arms in the great sweeping gestures so common to orators, but stood quite still, allowing his clear voice to persuade the audience. On the few occasions when he did lift his hand for emphasis, the effect was startling and forceful.The clock on the landing struck four and I came to myself, wondering what Mother would think of me, staring at a pile of books when I had so little time to prepare for the lecture. I could hear her voice in my ear, reminding me that punctuality was a courtesy that married trustworthiness to respect. I gathered my hair, rolled it up onto my head, secured it with combs, and studied the effect in the mirror.The face I saw there was unmistakably sad. My long chin and milky skin, my deep-set eyes, all hinted at some unnamed sorrow. I'd always believed my features too plain to attract notice, but now I considered that the fault might lie more in this melancholy gaze. I resolved to look more cheerful that evening.I removed my day gown and took my dress from the bed. The skirt swirled around me with a soft, gray hiss, like the sea upon the shore. Mother had insisted I wear such a dress to my first dance lesson when I was seven. It had been a blue silk gown with a white lace collar. I'd relished the sensation of the cool, slippery fabric against my arms and shoulders, though I did not want to attend the lessons. I believed dancing was one more severe restraint imposed on proper adult ladies. I'd been used to climbing trees and swinging on branches. Yet it was Mother's wish that both Lucy and I master all the womanly arts, and so once each week we walked up North Street to the Town Square. This duty soon became a privilege when my French dance master revealed that he was a distant cousin of Napoleon Bonaparte. I was immediately won over, for Napoleon was my hero.Monsieur Remy was a small man, only a few inches taller than I, with long, slender hands and auburn hair that fell to his shoulders. He favored bright colors and fine embroidery--though worn at the cuffs and collar, his waistcoats were always the latest fashion. Yet he never smiled. He regarded dancing with the same solemnity that my aunts viewed their Calvinist faith.I adored him.He taught me to carry myself like a princess. Each Wednesday morning Lucy and I appeared at his door, where we lifted the knocker shyly and waited for his white-haired housekeeper to grant us entrance. She never spoke to us, never once said our names, but smiled as she nodded us in and led us through the smoky kitchen. My heart never failed to race as I stepped into the cold room where Monsieur Remy waited.Though it was an empty bedchamber, to me it was a hall. The floorboards gleamed from the scouring of slippered feet. There were no drapes covering the room's three windows, so morning light drenched the walls and floor and expanded the empty room to grand proportions.Monsieur Remy was always there, standing at the window and looking out to sea, hands tucked neatly into the small of his back. On the first day he looked at me and, in an accent that melted the ends of his words, said, "You must submit each day to the discipline of the stocks. As soon as you start to dance, I will know if you've been faithful."The stocks were a single block of wood with back-to-back slots for the feet, so that when a dancer stood in them, her legs turned out and the backs of her heels touched. Lucy complained, but I stood in them every day for more than an hour. The pain always began slowly, deep inside my hips--from there it slid down to my knees, which began to throb after ten minutes. Then my calves protested and moments later my ankles as well, until I was encased in pain from the waist down. Yet I never avoided them. I bent my will to their iron discipline, for I loved dancing with all my heart.I practiced my steps for hours, urging my feet into the complex patterns, positioning my body with the regimen of a military officer, heel just so, toe pointing at that particular angle. Exactly as I was taught. I turned and bent and took small, exquisite leaps. I forced my body into positions it did not want to assume, for dancing required pitting myself against the forces of gravity and air. It was a sort of levitation, a defiance of the laws of nature. Though not--I was certain--the laws of God. No matter what my stern aunts told me, no matter how many times they warned me that I waspirouetting directly over the fires of hell, I knew God wanted me to dance. Why else would I feel so like an angel, as if I'd sprouted strong, white wings lifting me toward heaven?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>AT FOUR-THIRTY, Sophia and I stepped over the threshold into the crystalline air of late afternoon. For a moment I stood looking down the hill to the harbor. It was a view that always affected me because it so starkly symbolized the convergence of man and nature in the orderly march of buildings along the various wharves and the unbridled tumult of the ocean beyond. At the moment, the sea was calm, but I knew that the merest flick of God's finger could transform it into a tempest. Mrs. Brig's house had lost a shutter in the morning's storm, and the linden tree at the foot of the hill was leaning precipitously across the road. The brief sun of late afternoon had begun to melt the snow along the roadside, and I heard the trickle of water close by.Behind me loomed the reassuring bulk of Winslow House, like a mother's skirts protecting and enfolding me. It was where I'd been born and raised, where I'd lived most of my life, save the few years after my parents' death when I boarded with my aunt and uncle. A square-built, wooden house, covered in salt-grayed clapboards, it was handsome in its simple elegance, rising two-and-a-half stories at the end of North Street, on the broad promontory overlooking Plymouth Harbor. Its most notable feature was its double chimneys, which could be seen from Burial Hill, the high ridge where the Pilgrim forefathers lay.Sophia broke my reverie by taking my arm and begging me to hurry, lest we be late. We walked up North Street and beyond, to Town Square, where we found people streaming into the meetinghouse of the First Parish Church. The building, only recently completed, was made of wood and painted gray to resemble stone. Its centerpiece was the great circular stained-glass window that surmounted the doorway. The Gothic style seemed to be all the rage now, yet I wondered at the impulse that prompted this imitation of the cathedrals of Europe. Were we not a new and democratic nation? Should we not invent our own fashions?The pews were already crowded--the only available seats being the second-rate ones to the far right of the pulpit. I grasped Sophia's arm and pulled her smoothly past the round knees of Thomas Batchelder, then settled myself quickly on the wooden bench. I was relieved to note that Mr. Emerson hadnot yet entered the pulpit. I smoothed my skirts and straightened my bonnet, then discreetly signaled Sophia to straighten hers.A ripple of voices at the back of the room drew my attention, and I turned to see Mr. Emerson walk down the aisle. His brown hair glinted in the lamplight, his face serene and composed. He climbed the steps, his arms at his sides. He was a tall man with an unusually long neck and sloping shoulders, a feature of his anatomy that gave him an air of cultivation and congeniality. I noticed that his dark suit betrayed a genteel poverty in the sheen at the elbows and the fraying threads at his cuffs.I sat at an unfortunate angle to the pulpit and there were three tall men seated in front of me. I could not see properly without stretching sideways and craning my neck. Mr. Emerson took some folded papers from the pocket of his jacket and laid them on the lectern. In profile, his nose was beaklike and reminded me of an eagle, an image that somehow matched the sharp blue of his eyes. He turned and his gaze swept over the audience and I imagined that they rested momentarily on me. The sensation unsettled me, but left in its wake a not-unpleasant tingle at the nape of my neck.I refolded my hands--when had they separated and clenched the bench?--and pressed them deep into my lap, then glanced at Sophia, who was again playing with her bonnet strings. I had no time to correct her, for at that moment Mr. Emerson began to speak.As I listened to his words--and not merely his words, but the music of his voice--I felt a strange constriction of my mind and heart. His voice was melodious and oddly calming--its lyric quality made me think of a summer sea. It was as if his tone exerted a physical pressure in my brain, changing its shape and opening it to new ideas.His lecture lasted nearly two hour...</p><h2>Chlo� (Memoire)</h2><p>A leading brand in women's ready-to-wear, Chloe remains a symbol of new fashion: modern, feminine, with a Left Bank spirit. Chloe presented its debut collection at Cafe Flore in 1956 with a few simple and elegant models. For the first time, fashion came down to the street and touched the hearts of women.

But while the architecture and furniture have received most of the attention, the colorful table linens, curtains, pillows, clothing, and other textiles have been largely overlooked. This lavishly illustrated volume will delight the eye and become the standard reference on these treasures from our past. <p>Especially valuable are the book's rare photographs, some showing the textiles in period settings. There is a wealth of important historical information, and sections on needlework techniques and caring for antique textiles. The striking designs themselves and the interiors in which they are pictured will provide inspiration for decorators, designers, collectors, and needlecrafters alike.</p></p><p>Dianne Ayres is a textile designer and founder of Arts &amp; Crafts Period Textiles. She and her husband, Timothy Hansen, write and lecture widely on Arts and Crafts textiles and design. Ayres and Hansen are based in Oakland, CA. Tommy Arthur McPherson II is Director of the organization that administers Gustav Stickley's Morris Plains, NJ, home, Craftsman Farms, as a National Historic Landmark. Beth Ann McPherson is Curator for interpretation at Craftsman Farms, where the McPhersons live.Often the Arts and Crafts movement is recognized by its architectural and furniture design, which evolved from the late 19th to the early 20th centuries and was epitomized by designers such as Gustav Stickley. However, this stylistic and philosophical movement encompassed the entire household, including the linen closet. This book provides a comprehensive study of the textile arts of this period, which are often overlooked. The four authors are all textile specialists involved with Arts and Crafts restoration. Following the development of the movement, from William Morris to American Colonial Revival style, they effectively portray the convergence of influences and the development of the style. They also show how the growth of home ownership, craft schools, and popular kits and instructions lent to the hearty adoption of the Arts and Crafts style by the American middle class. A final chapter on the care and restoration of antique textiles is quite useful. Unfortunately, the quality of the illustrations is inconsistent some are excellent, being both large and detailed, while others, especially the reproductions of period publications, are woefully small. However, there are no comparable books devoted solely to Arts and Crafts textiles, and this one covers the subject admirably. Recommended for larger public libraries.

When Senator Joseph McCarthy began his notorious witch hunt for Communists in the late 1940s, Bernstein&#x2014;a writer for film and television&#x2014;found himself blacklisted. For a decade he would scrape a living together by selling scripts through front men. Jonathan Yardley of the <i>Washington Post</i> has called <i>Inside Out</i> "a lovely piece of work . . . a memoir of the blacklist that, without minimizing any of its offenses or forgiving any of its architects, finds humanity and humor in the period." The author vividly recalls an entertainment community torn between those who were willing and those who refused to denounce their friends, and he provides unforgettable glimpses of leading Hollywood figures such as Burt Lancaster, Elia Kazan, Bette Davis, and Zero Mostel. The <i>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</i> has hailed this as, simply, "the best personal account of the era."</p><p>Walter Bernstein was a war correspondent for the U.S. army magazine <i>Yank</i>. During World War II, he joined the Communist Party in 1946 after he was inspired by the Communist partisans in France and Yugoslavia. (He had interviewed Marshall Tito for the magazine.) Shortly afterwards Joe McCarthy's House Committee on Un-American Activities initiated its notorious witch-hunt for Reds in the government and, to garner publicity, in Hollywood, where Bernstein had become a writer for film and television. Though he successfully avoided appearing before the Committee, Bernstein was blacklisted, and forced to scrape a living together by selling his scripts through front men. In this memoir, he recalls the days of the blacklist, celebrates the movie business, and defends his political allegiances.ely alive and pointed memoir by a writer who was himself blacklisted during what Lillian Hellman so aptly called &#34;scoundrel time, &#34; Bernstein recounts his passage from idealist to scapegoat. Chronicling his writing careers in Hollywood and then television, Bernstein tells of the blacklisting for communism which brought ostracism, FBI surveillance, and a search for &#34;fronts&#34; to take credit for his work. of photos.</p><h2>The Ra expeditions;</h2><p>Signed by adventurer Thor Heyerdahl.

Praised by popes, mystics and theologians, this profound and powerful book presents Mary as the essential and infallible key to the heart of Jesus. Nowhere will you find a deeper and more life-changing book on that quintessentially Catholic doctrine: the role of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the life of the Christian and the life of the Church. Unpublished during the saint s life time, it has enjoyed the endorsement of the many outstanding popes the Church has been blessed with since its discovery in 1842. John Paul II, in particular, was its tireless champion, crediting True Devotion with a turning-point in his spiritual life, adopting his motto, Totus tuus, from St. Louis. The key to De Montfort&#39;s Marian spirituality is that he considered Our Lady to be the infallible and chosen gate to the heart of Christ To Jesus through Mary: it is Christ Himself Who is at the centre of True Devotion.

From his youth he was distinguished by a singular devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. In Rome, Pope Clement XI conferred on him the title and authority of Missionary Apostolic, which enabled him to continue his apostolate after returning to France. A member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic, Saint Louis was one of the greatest apostles of the Rosary in his day, and by means his miraculously inspiring book, The Secret of the Rosary, he is still so today; the most common manner of reciting the Rosary is the method that originated with Saint Louis s preaching. In 1715, he founded a missionary band known as the Company of Mary. He preached the devotion of Total Consecration to Jesus through Mary everywhere and to everyone, and wrote the books (such as True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin) that would make it accessible and easily understandable for the faithful. Worn out by intense preaching and prayer, he died in 1716 and was canonized by Pope Ven. Pius XII in 1947.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Long Range Desert Group 1940-1945: Providence Their Guide</h2><p>In a campaign known for many special warfare units, the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) became one of the greatest legends of the North African Campaign in World War II.

Popes, theologians, lawyers&#x2015;all were bound by the divine truth it conveyed. Yet the church possessed no absolute means of determining the final authoritative meaning of the biblical text&#x2015;hence the range of appeals to antiquity, to the papacy, and to councils, none of which were ultimately conclusive. Authority in the late medieval church was a vexing issue precisely because it was not resolved.<br><br>Ian Christopher Levy&#x2019;s book focuses on the quest for such authority between 1370 and 1430, from John Wyclif to Thomas Netter, thereby encompassing the struggle over Holy Scripture waged between Wycliffites and Hussites on the one hand, and their British and Continental opponents on the other. Levy demonstrates that the Wycliffite/Hussite &#x201c;heretics&#x201d; and their opponents&#x2015;the theologians William Woodford, Thomas Netter, and Jean Gerson&#x2015;in fact shared a large and undisputed common ground. They held recognized licenses of expertise, venerated tradition, esteemed the church fathers, and embraced Holy Scripture as the ultimate authority in Christendom. What is more, they utilized similar hermeneutical strategies with regard to authorial intention, the literal sense, and the appeal to the fathers and holy doctors in order to open up the text. Yet it is precisely this commonality, according to Levy, that rendered the situation virtually intractable; he argues that the erroneous assumption persists today that Netter and Gerson spoke for &#x201c;the church,&#x201d; whereas Wyclif and Hus sought to destroy it.<br><br>Levy&#x2019;s sophisticated study in historical theology, which reconsiders the paradigm of heresy and orthodoxy, offers a necessary adjustment in our view of church authority at the turn of the fifteenth century.</p><p>Ian Christopher Levy is associate professor of theology at Providence College, Providence, Rhode Island.&#x201c;For the potential reader, this brilliant book is beautifully written in clear prose. . . . From start to finish, Ian Levy is a model teacher, telling us what he intends to do, then doing it, and in the final chapter, &#x2018;<i>The Enduring Dilemma</i>,&#x2019; allowing himself to go beyond the Council of Constance and into the fifteenth century, which thus forms a bridge to sixteenth-century reformations.&#x201d; (The American Benedictine Review)<br><br>&#x201c;This richly learned, intellectually ambitious and eloquent book locates John Wyclif within the history of late-medieval Biblical exegesis as never before, placing him in revealing relation to his predecessors and successors, his friends and foes. Ian Levy&#x2019;s authority as a guide to the truth of this perplexing and controversial matter is unsurpassed. Here is indispensable reading for anyone interested in late-medieval religious debate in England, and its continental consequences.&#x201d; (Alastair Minnis, Yale University)<br><br>&#x201c;In this absorbing study of the complex relation of scripture interpretation and church authority, Levy provides a thorough, erudite overview of an important aspect of Wycliffism&#x2019;s challenge to the late medieval church. But he does more than simply acquaint the reader with Wyclif, Hus, Woodford, Netter, and other theorists. He convincingly argues that Wyclif and Hus were not the bibliolatrous radicals their opponents made them out to be. Levy effectively shows how the threat of Wycliffism&#x2019;s reading of the Bible arose more from a need to define ecclesiastical authority than from a hermeneutic heterodoxy. Indeed, Levy makes the abstract realm of late medieval scripture hermeneutics come alive as he redresses the mischaracterizations that have bedeviled Wyclif and Hus for so long.&#x201d; (Stephen E. Lahey, University of Nebraska)<br><br>&#x201c;In&nbsp;Holy Scripture and the Quest for Authority at the End of the Middle Ages,&nbsp;Ian Christopher Levy reveals the crux of a late medieval quandary regarding ecclesial authority. He perceptively shows how theologians and the Catholic Church were mired in a nearly intractable constellation of issues involving scriptural interpretation, appeals to tradition, development of doctrine, the question of concrete, visible instruments of authority, and the role of canon law and university theologians. This highly original contribution treats themes and issues at an immensely complex and important juncture in the development of early modern religious thought and practice, the ramifications of which are still very much with us today.&#x201d; (Boyd Taylor Coolman, Boston College)<br><br>&#x201c;[This book] focuses on the fundamental problems of finding authority to resolve religious controversies and deciding which sources or traditions had primacy over the others. . . . Levy negotiates the details of the controversies and the complexities of the various actors in this debate masterfully.&#x201d; (Comitatus)<br><br>&#x201c;This well-written study tackles an important and essentially unanswerable question about the determination of authority in the late Middle Ages. The simplest answer to the question is that the scriptures are the foundation to which theology, canon law, and indeed the papacy are all subject, but establishing an authoritative reading of the scriptures within the context of tradition is anything but simple.&#x201d; (Renaissance Quarterly)<br><br>&#x201c;Ian Christopher Levy . . . presents a radical rereading of late-medieval theology, with a particular focus on Wyclif and Hus and their opponents, and a surprising presentation of the &#x2018;orthodox&#x2019; foundations of these two famous teachers, masters understood by many of their contemporaries as archetypes of heretics. . . . The theologies of Wyclif and Hus were not a radical departure from the medieval Catholic exegetical tradition, and Levy does a masterful job not only in demonstrating this, but also in providing the context to understand this more fully.&#x201d; (The Thomist)<br><br>&#x201c;The rivalry which has been traced by many scholars seeking to understand why the controversies of the late Middle Ages led to the Reformation has commonly been seen in terms of &#x2018;Church&#x2019; versus &#x2018;Scripture.&#x2019; But as this refreshing study reminds us, there was [a] third protagonist. This was the exegetical tradition which had developed down the ages in the West. . . .

Are our human efforts all in vain, or is there some meaning to be found? In the end, it is a struggle with death itself. Dr. Kast interprets everyday events, fairy tales and psychotherapy issues in light of the Sisyphus theme, rendering it a kaleidoscope through which we can look deeply into ourselves. Verena Kast deals with a problem that also fascinated Nietzsche and Freud.

Part One of the book will establish a tactical system meant to replace the Principles of War checklist. First, the contextual role of tactics with regards to strategy and war will be established. This will necessarily lean on major strategic theories in order to illuminate the role of tactics. This section will be formed around the Physical, Mental, and Moral planes of battlefield interaction used by theorists such as J.F.C Fuller and John Boyd. Each plane will then be examined in turn, and many of the classic Principles of War will be discussed along with some new ones. It will present some standard methods that tacticians can use to gain an advantage on the battlefield using historical examples that illustrate each concept. These "tactical tenets" include maneuver, mass, firepower, tempo, surprise, deception, confusion, shock, and the role of the moral aspects of combat. Finally, Part One will circle back around by discussing the role of tactical victory- once achieved- in contributed to a strategy. Part One is short by design. It is intended to be both compelling and easily mastered for junior non-commissioned officers and company grade officers, while still rich enough to be interesting to both specialist and non-specialist academics. It is a book meant not just for bookshelves but also for ruck sacks and cargo pockets.<br><br><p>Part Two will build on Part One by exploring concepts with which the tactician must be familiar with such as the culminating point of victory, mission tactics and decentralized command and control, offensive and defensive operations, and the initiative. Part Three will conclude the book examining implications of the presented tactical systems to a variety of other issues in strategic studies.</p></p><p>B. A.

In this intimate history, Valerie Paradiz tells the real story of the greatest literary collaboration of the nineteenth century, and gives the long-lost narrators of these beloved tales their due. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were major German intellects of their time, contemporaries of both Goethe and Schiller. But as Paradiz reveals here, the romantic image of the two brothers traveling the countryside, transcribing tales told to them by peasants, is far from the truth. More than half of the tales the Grimm brothers collected were contributed by women friends from the upper classes. Set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars and the high years of German romanticism, <i>Clever Maids</i> chronicles this most fascinating enterprise in literary history, and illuminates the ways the Grimm tales-with their mythic portrayals of courage, sacrifice, and betrayal-still resonate so powerfully today.</p><p><b>Valerie Paradiz</b> holds a Ph.D. in German Studies and has taught at Bard College. She is the author of <i>Elijah's Cup</i>, as well as numerous translations. She lives in the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York.Contrary to popular myth, the Brothers Grimm collected their stories not from peasants but from educated young women in their locale of Kassel, Westphalia. Paradiz (<i>Elijah's Cup</i>) has researched the lives of these feminine "fairytale think tanks" to whom the philologist brothers Grimm were so indebted. In doing so, she also details the family life of six Grimm children and their mother's struggles after the premature death of their lawyer father. Sketching in broad terms the Romantic German nationalist aims of the Grimm stories, Paradiz notes the irony that several of the tales were of French origin, having traveled to Germany through Huguenot immigration. She devotes a chapter to each woman contributor, among them the sullen lone Grimm sister, Lotte, burdened with the family's household chores; the much loved girl-next-door, Dortchen Wild, who contributed "Rumplestiltskin" and later married Wilhelm; the upper-class Hassenpflug sisters, who contributed a variety of tales, including "Puss in Boots" and "Little Red Riding Hood." Paradiz interestingly recounts how the Grimm brothers perceived some female contributors as threatening and unfeminine, while lauding others for their submissive, helpful personalities, and she mines the women's contributions for possible deviations from male stereotypes of the time. While her analysis is too tentative to amount to a coherent thesis, this accessible book brings unsung heroines of literature to light and will inform readers of women's history and literature. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

These sages sought to comprehend the origin and essence of things and pondered how it was possible to learn and obtain insight. Wisdom, they came to see, was the &#x201c;fashioner of all things&#x201d; who disclosed &#x201c;what is secret and what is manifest.&#x201d; Many of these Jewish intellectuals saw Wisdom as the closest being to God.In this book, five of the world's foremost scholars in the field reflect on the Wisdom traditions in Second Temple Judaism and earliest Christianity. Roland Murphy (late of Duke University) explores the biblical and Jewish wisdom literature, and focuses on ways that Jews sought to understand sin and suffering.Peter Sch�fer (Princeton University) argues that the association of Wisdom, Torah, and Israel found in biblical literature was taken up much later in the writings of the Rabbinic sages.Peder Borgen (formerly University of Trondheim, Norway) examines the similarities in the writings of the Hellenistic Jewish Wisdom teacher Philo of Alexandria and the writer of the Gospel of John.D. Moody Smith (Duke University) focuses on the Passion narrative in the Gospel of John as he demonstrates how much John relies on Jewish Wisdom tradition in his gospel. James Charlesworth (PrincetonTheological Seminary) examines the Wisdom aspects of some Jewish apocalypses in order to demonstrate that the Gospel of John draws upon both the Jewish Wisdom literature and Jewish apocalypses. James H. Charlesworth is George L.

It is instead an erudite delving into the significance of all kinds of trivia created, manufactured, produced--even sung--about America's first president...Marling holds all the cards--she knows her historical context, she has the images and messages at her fingertips, and she has an almost unerring sense of the ridiculous, providing a very witty interpretation of a nostalgia that pervades American life. (Beatrice B. Garvan <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>)<br><br>This book, written by an astute professor of American studies and art history at the University of Minnesota, is intriguing because it also concerns the role of that on-again, off-again colonial revival in popular culture from 1876 until the present. Karal Ann Marling's discussion demonstrates her skill at interweaving words and images, books and the bizarre detritus from our commercialization of the past that stand (or perhaps languish) in need of explication...Ms. Marling has salvaged quantities of consequential colonial ephemera. These are the accretions which simultaneously embellish yet enshroud our national myths; and she has sandblasted those hollow shrines while preserving all the rubble and dust for our delectation.

It was in India he met Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and began his studies into Theosophy and other aspects of the occult world. &#39;Esoteric Buddhism&#39; was first published in 1883. Wide-ranging in scope, the book covers topics as diverse as life after death, Karma, the origin of Evil, The Chain of Globes, psychic perception, Nirvana, and Esoteric Cosmogony. Delving so deeply into what Sinnett considers &#34;absolute truth&#34;, the work also highlights the many ways in which Buddhist esotericism agrees with the occult wisdom of other faiths.</p><p>Alfred Percy Sinnett (18 January 1840, London - 26 June 1921) was an English author and Theosophist. Sinnett's father died while he was young, by 1851 Sinnett is listed as a "Scholar &#x2013; London University", living with his widowed mother Jane whose occupation is listed as "Periodical Literature", and his older sister Sophia age 22 who is a teacher. Jane's sister Sarah age 48 is also a teacher. Sinnett married his wife Patience in 1870, probably in the London area. He is listed in the 1871 England Census at age 31, as a Journalist, born in Middlesex. His wife Patience is 27, and her mother Clarissa Edenson a "Landowner", is living with them. By 1879, Sinnett had moved to India where he was "... the Editor of The Pioneer, the leading English Daily of India..." He relates in his book, The Occult World that: "...on the first occasion of my making Madame Blavatsky's acquaintance she became a guest at my home at Allahabad and remained there for six weeks..." In 1880 Helena Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott visited the Sinnetts at their summer-home in Simla. The Mahatma letters, which generated the controversy that later helped lead to the split of the Theosophical Society, were mostly written to Sinnett or his wife, Patience. The letters started at this time when Sinnett asked Blavatsky whether if he wrote a letter to her Mahatmas, she could arrange to have it delivered. By 1884, Sinnett was back in England, where that year Constance Wachtmeister states that she met Blavatsky at the home of the Sinnetts in London. Sinnett asked Charles Webster Leadbeater to come back to England to tutor his son Percy and George Arundale. Leadbeater agreed and brought with him one of his pupils Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa. Using "astral clairvoyance" Leadbeater assisted William Scott-Elliot to write his book The Story of Atlantis, for which Sinnett wrote the preface. Sinnett was later President of the London Lodge of the Society. By 1901, Sinnett is listed as an author. His son Percy is also listed as an author and born in India.</p><h2>Case of the Absent Author, The</h2><p>Searching for a missing mystery writer, the McGurk Organization wonders how the author&#39;s forthcoming deadline played a part in his disappearance and track down a series of leads stemming from clues that the author has left for them.</p><p>Gr. 4^-6. When mystery writer William LeGrand disappears without a trace, his literary agent approaches J. P. McGurk and his detective gang to locate the missing author and his hidden cache of manuscripts. Because the sleuths find all sorts of clues relating to Edgar Allan Poe's poems and stories, which were planted by LeGrand himself, they deduce that his disappearance has been staged. Later, a cut telephone line and a full but moldy refrigerator convince them he has been kidnapped. Hildick judiciously sprinkles clues and illustrative diagrams throughout the story, allowing young readers to match wits with these master crime writers. Quirky characters (including Lady Thumb from an earlier mystery) and clever dialogue add to the appeal, making this a good choice for McGurk fans and detective story enthusiasts. <i>Kay Weisman</i></p><h2>Speed, Style, and Beauty - Cars From the Ralph Lauren Collection</h2><p>Shipped from UK, please allow 10 to 21 business days for arrival. 210pp. Crease across bottom corner of front cover, v. minor soiling to back cover ; condition near fine.</p><p></p><h2>The ABC Murders [TV Tie-in]: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Hercule Poirot Mysteries)</h2><p><p><strong>Agatha Christie&#x2019;s beloved classic&nbsp;novel sets Hercule Poirot on the trail of a serial killer&#x2014;now a limited streaming series starring John Malkovich, Rupert Grint, and Tara Fitzgerald.</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;There is no more cunning player of the murder game than Agatha Christie.&#x201d;&#x2014;&nbsp;<em>Sunday Times</em> (London)<br><br></strong></p><p>&#x201c;Let us see, Mr. Clever Poirot, just how clever you can be.&#x201d;</p><p>There&#x2019;s a serial killer on the loose, working his way through the alphabet and the whole country is in a state of panic.</p><p><strong>A</strong> is for Mrs. Ascher in Andover, <strong>B</strong> is for Betty Barnard in Bexhill, <strong>C</strong> is for Sir Carmichael Clarke in Churston.

First published in 1940, it focuses on the lynching of three innocent men and the tragedy that ensues when law and order are abandoned. The result is an emotionally powerful, vivid, and unforgettable re-creation of the Western novel, which Clark transmuted into a universal story about good and evil, individual and community, justice and human nature. As Wallace Stegner writes, [Clark&#39;s] theme was civilization, and he recorded, indelibly, its first steps in a new country.Wallace Stegner's many books include <b>Crossing to Safety</b>, <b>Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs</b>, and the Pulitzer Prize winning <b>Angle of Repose</b>.</p><h2>War Game</h2><p>Four English boys emerge from the trenches of World War I during a Christmas Day cease-fire and join in an enlightening soccer game involving soldiers from both sides of the war, in a story based on an actual event.</p><p><b>Michael Foreman</b> is one of the outstanding creators of children's picture books today.&nbsp;He&nbsp;has won an&nbsp;array of prizes, including the Kate Greenaway Award, the Smarties Book Prize, the Kurt Maschler Award, and the Children's Book Award.Dedicated to the memory of four uncles who died in WW I, Foreman's moving, informative follow-up to War Boy is crammed with concrete details and permeated with emotion. Freddie, Billy, Lacey and Will, youths from the English countryside, find themselves caught up in the euphoria of flag-waving and patriotism when war breaks out in 1914. From every mailbox, every wall, posters demand devotion to king and country; reproductions of these posters alternate with Foreman's understated watercolors. Amid cheers and jubilation, the four sign up. Their excitement is palpable as they head off to France, and the sensitive illustrations distill their sense of adventure. "We'll be back by Christmas," they think, but are met at the front with gunfire, rain, mud, hunger and death. Hope reigns anew on Christmas Day, when the Germans and the "Tommies" play soccer, exchange gifts and greetings, but it is short-lived. Foreman draws the many sides of war with heartbreaking clarity as he transmutes the personal experiences of his uncles into a universal story. Artwork shimmers with the luster of memory and fellow-feeling; a gentle gleam rises even from military hardware, which serves to both soften and highlight the horror of war. History springs to life in this admirable work, the 1993 winner of Britain's Smarties Book Prize.

(historical fiction). Simultaneous.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, September 2012:</strong> When Willie Sutton walked from Attica Prison on Christmas, 1969, the Irish, Brooklyn-born bank robber reemerged as a folk hero for American everymen fed up with a financial system that favored the rich. Infamous for his flair for disguise, Willie the Actor and his crew shook down 100 banks between the 1920s and his final arrest in 1952. He claimed to have never killed anyone, but he spent over half his adult life in prison, where he saved his sanity by reading classics and meticulously plotting audacious escapes--some successful. In <em>Sutton</em>, J.R. Moehringer (<em>The Tender Bar</em>) performs a similarly audacious feat, tunneling through layers of legend and emerging with a novel that hums with the truth of Sutton's life, with all its dramatic contradictions. Shifting easily between Willie's first Christmas of freedom and the pivotal events of his past, Moehringer's tale of how lost love and desperation compelled Sutton to feats of (admittedly criminal) brilliance rivals those in <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>. --<em>Mari Malcolm</em><br>J.R.

Best known as the bard of Broadway for turning two-bit hustlers and deadbeat horseplayers of Jazz Age New York City into literary legend, Runyon was first and foremost a newspaperman. After arriving in New York from Colorado in 1911, Runyon went to work for Hearst News Service as a baseball beat writer. It was at the ballpark that he honed his legendary skills for finding the story where no one else bothered to look. A master wordsmith, Runyon covered giants of the era such as Ty Cobb, and a Boston Red Sox pitcher named Babe Ruth. In addition, he brought an influential style to observing the rituals and rhythms of the ballpark, wryly commenting on everything from the gamblers and bookies doing business to the particular style of hat worn by a woman in the crowd. Editor Jim Reisler collects Runyon's writings on every facet of the game, making this a unique and indispensable look at our beloved pastime.</p><p></p><h2>Exalted (Role Playing Game Book)</h2><p>Youve Heard the Rumors <br> Before the Impergium before the Mythic Ages before the Sundering before there was a World of Darkness there was something else.

"Eh-yah, didn't think it would amount to much," muses Fred. But it did, and caught both of them unhappily by surprise: shy Fred found himself stuck in a lively, crowded tavern in town, while Walt was forced to take cover alone in his barn. When the snow eventually stopped, and they could finally dig themselves out, the two friends passed each other on the road-one desperate to get out of the bustling pub, the other equally desperate to get in. Schindler's ink-and-watercolor art captures the rolling, leafless, brown-and-gray landscape of Massachusetts in March, and then buries it in dense white snow. The art is infused with period details, from delivering milk in a horse-drawn cart to dinners lit by candlelight. Hurst's call-and-response narrative approach, consisting solely of the old men's terse dialogue, works well with the page layout and captures the rhythms of a story told, back and forth, many times over.

Sicilian Carousel is his only piece of extended writing on the country and, naturally enough for the islomaniac Durrell, it focuses on one of Italy&#39;s islands. Sicilian Carousel came relatively late in Durrell&#39;s career, and is based around a slightly fictionalized bus tour of the island.</p><p>Born in Jalandhar, British India, in 1912 to Indian-born British colonials, Lawrence Durrell was a critically hailed and beloved novelist, poet, humorist, and travel writer best known for the Alexandria Quartet novels, which were ranked by the Modern Library as among the greatest works of English literature in the twentieth century. A passionate and dedicated writer from an early age, Durrell s prolific career also included the groundbreaking Avignon Quintet, whose first novel, &#34;Monsieur &#34;(1974), won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and whose third novel, &#34;Constance &#34;(1982), was nominated for the Booker Prize. He also penned the celebrated travel memoir &#34;Bitter Lemons of Cyprus &#34;(1957), which won the Duff Cooper Prize. Durrell corresponded with author Henry Miller for forty-five years, and Miller influenced much of his early work, including a provocative and controversial novel, &#34;The Black Book &#34;(1938). Durrell died in France in 1990.</p><h2>The Opium War: Drugs, Dreams and the Making of China</h2><p>`On the outside, [the foreigners] seem intractable, but inside they are cowardly. . . Although there have been a few ups-and-downs, the situation as a whole is under control.&#39; In October 1839, a few months after the Chinese Imperial Commissioner, Lin Zexu, dispatched these confident words to his emperor, a cabinet meeting in Windsor voted to fight Britain&#39;s first Opium War (1839-42) with China. The conflict turned out to be rich in tragicomedy: in bureaucratic fumblings, military missteps, political opportunism and collaboration. Yet over the past 170 years, this strange tale of misunderstanding, incompetence and compromise has become the founding myth of modern Chinese nationalism: the start of China&#39;s heroic struggle against a Western conspiracy to destroy the country with opium and gunboat diplomacy. Beginning with the dramas of the war itself, Julia Lovell explores its causes and consequences and, through this larger narrative, interweaves the curious stories of opium&#39;s promoters and attackers. The Opium War is both the story of modern China - starting from this first conflict with the West - and an analysis of the country&#39;s contemporary self-image. It explores how China&#39;s national myths mould its interactions with the outside world, how public memory is spun to serve the present; and how delusion and prejudice have bedevilled its relationship with the modern West.</p><p>Julia Lovell teaches modern Chinese history at Birkbeck College, University of London. She is the author of The Great Wall: China Against the World and The Politics of Cultural Capital: China&#39;s Quest for a Nobel Prize in Literature and writes on China for the Guardian, Independent and The Times Literary Supplement. Her many translations of modern Chinese fiction include, most recently, Lu Xun&#39;s The Real Story of Ah-Q, and Other Tales of China.&#x201c;A crisp readable account [Lovell] keeps a sharp plot running, which is a testament to her writing skills . . .

With assistance from Pulitzer-winning journalist Powers (coauthor, One Goal, 1984, etc.), Gowdy makes unobtrusive use of his long career in broadcasting to recall notable post-WW II teams and events. He was at the local mike, for instance, when Bud Wilkinson began making Oklahoma a college-football power and Hank Iba's Oklahoma A&amp;M basketball squads were beating almost all comers. Moving east in 1949 to become Mel Allen's junior partner in broadcasting New York Yankees games, the author was an eyewitness to the dynastic renaissance of the Yankees, who, under the quirky aegis of Casey Stengel, dominated pro baseball for much of the 1950's. Offered a chance to be number one, Gowdy decamped for Boston in 1951 to air Red Sox games, a job that let him become the first voice of the Celtics as well. While he focuses on his era's storied contests and notables (e.g., Red Auerbach, Doc Blanchard, Glenn Davis, Joe DiMaggio, Bill Russell, Tom Yawkey), the author doesn't shrink from recounting its low points--in particular the point-shaving scandals that cost college basketball a full measure of innocence. Gowdy nonetheless manages to end his anecdotal, episodic narrative with an upbeat, I-was-there account of the home run that Ted Williams belted out of Fenway Park during his final time at bat in the major leagues, in 1960. Manna for older fans who may have forgotten how sweet it was, and a fine reminder for younger generations that artificial turf, integrated squads, TV coverage, drug-testing, seven-figure contracts, platooning, and seemingly endless playoffs weren't always in the game. (Illustrations--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This nostalgic volume will appeal mainly to sports fans over 50, for Gowdy, who was a broadcaster in Oklahoma, New York and Boston, and Powers ( Mary Lou ) reminisce about football, basketball and baseball in the post-WW II years. Their special fondness for dynasties is expressed by their focus on Bud Wilkinson's reign as football coach at Oklahoma University, the basketball regimes of Hank Iba at Oklahoma A &amp; M and Adolph Rupp at Kentucky, the New York Yankees under Casey Stengel and the Boston Celtics managed by Red Auerbach. There are passing glimpses at George Mikan, Satchel Paige, Joe DiMaggio and Clair Bee, as well as in-depth looks at Ted Williams and Tom Yawkey. Although the book is a vivid recollection of the era, it won't much interest those who think of Walt Frazier and Stan Musial as old-timers.

A world-renowned writer and philosopher, he is the leading authority in the field of creative thinking and the direct teaching of thinking as a skill. Dr de Bono has written more than 60 books, in 40 languages, with people now teaching his methods worldwide. He has chaired a special summit of Nobel Prize laureates, and been hailed as one of the 250 people who have contributed most to mankind.A deceptively simple but consistently provocative appeal for perceptual (as opposed to structured) thinking from the author of Six Action Shoes (the trifle reviewed below), Tactics (1984), and several other works dealing with powers of the mind. As before, de Bono (an M.D. who no longer practices) challenges traditional Western thought processes on grounds that they are unequal to the task of solving the Global Village's many pressing problems. According to the author, orthodox methods of thinking are based on absolutes, a rigid insistence on facts, and other unproductive habits dating back to an ancient time when truth seekers like Aristotle relied on reason or its corollaries (analysis, logic, etc.) to free themselves from the bonds of dogma. While essentially adversarial methods are fine for achieving technological gains or winning arguments, de Bono says, such systems lack the originality and creativity required to deal with socioeconomic as well as political affairs. Describing the human brain as a self-organizing marvel, the author makes a strong case for what he calls ``water logic,'' a purportedly natural activity of the physical organ's neural network. By de Bono's account, water logic represents a fluid approach that provides the basis for new ideas, humor, insights, poetry, and other of civilization's more fruitful pleasures. On occasion, de Bono can be decidedly arbitrary in advancing his theories. Without much supporting evidence, for example, he dismisses language as a trap and characterizes humor as the intellect's most significant behavior (owning mainly to its asymmetry). In aid of breakthrough conjecture, however, the author is never less than thought-provoking, and his witty, allusive text is notable for its wealth of illuminating digressions. An offbeat treatise that charts a course out of the mainstream and along the varied routes that, perhaps, lead to unconventional wisdom. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Beginning in the theatre as a designer, he turned to acting and appeared with regional companies and Shakespeare festivals across the country. He made his New York directorial debut with an Off Broadway production of Chekhov s Ivanov which won the Obie and Vernon Rice Drama Desk Awards for 1958. He subsequently directed at Houston s Alley Theatre; San Francisco s Actor s Workshop; Washington, D.C. s Arena Stage; San Diego s Old Globe Theatre; and staged several New York City Opera productions. His 1959 Off Broadway production of Under Milk Wood won both the Lola D Annunzio and the Outer Circle Critics Awards, and in 1962 his Six Characters in Search of an Author proved another multiple award winner and had an extended New York run. After directing at Canada s Stratford Festival, Ball returned to New York to write the libretto, with composer Lee Hoiby for an opera, Natalya Petrovna, based on A Month in the Country. In 1964 he directed Tartuffe and Homage to Shakespeare at Lincoln Center and then traveled to London to recreate his staging of Six Characters.<br><br>Ball has been the recipient of a Fulbright scholarship, a Ford Foundation directorial grant, and an NBC RCA director s fellowship. Of his many productions for A.C.T., three were also directed for PBS television, includingThe Taming of the Shrew, for which he was nominated by the Television Critics Circle as best director of the year. In June 1979, Mr. Ball accepted the Antoinette Perry ( Tony ) Award voted to A.C.T. for its outstanding work in repertory performance and advanced theatre training. In the same year, Carnegie Mellon University presented him with an honorary degree as Doctor of Fine Arts.

This walk crosses three National Parks.</p><p>Born in Blackburn in 1907, Alfred Wainwright left school at the age of 13. A holiday at the age of 23 kindled a life-long love affair with the Lake District. Following a move to Kendal in 1941 he began to devote every spare moment he had to researching and compiling the original seven Pictorial Guides. He described these as his &#39;love letters&#39; to the Lakeland Fells and at the end of the first, The Eastern Fells, he wrote about what the mountains had come to mean to him: &#34;I suppose it might be said, to add impressiveness to the whole thing, that this book has been twenty years in the making, for it is so long, and more, since I first came from a smoky mill-town (forgive me, Blackburn!) and beheld, from Orrest Head, a scene of great beauty, a fascinating paradise, Lakeland&#39;s mountains and trees and water. That was the first time I had looked upon beauty, or imagined it, even. Afterwards I went often, whenever I could, and always my eyes were lifted to the hills. I was to find then, and it has been so ever since, a spiritual and physical satisfaction in climbing mountains - and a tranquil mind upon reaching their summits, as though I had escaped from the disappointments and unkindnesses of life and emerged above them into a new world, a better world. In due course I came to live within sight of the hills, and I was well content. If I could not be climbing, I was happy to sit idly and dream of them, serenely. Then came a restlessness and the feeling that it was not enough to take their gifts and do nothing in return. I must dedicate something of myself, the best part of me, to them. I started to write about them, and to draw pictures of them. Doing these things, I found they were still giving and I still receiving, for a great pleasure filled me when I was so engaged - I had found a new way of escape to them and from all else less worth while. Thus it comes about that I have written this book. Not for material gain, welcome though that would be (you see I have not escaped entirely!); not for the benefit of my contemporaries, though if it brings them also to the hills I shall be well pleased; certainly not for posterity, about which I can work up no enthusiasm at all. No, this book has been written, carefully and with infinite patience, for my own pleasure and because it has seemed to bring the hills to my own fireside. If it has merit, it is because the hills have merit.&#34; A. Wainwright died in 1991 at the age of 84.</p><h2>Forbidden Fruit (Corinna Chapman Mysteries)</h2><p><p><strong>"Like Corinna's earlier adventures, this episode is cleverly written and chock full of charming characters, interesting puzzles and luscious descriptions of food with appended recipes." &#x2015;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><em></em></p><p>Corinna Chapman, owner of the bakery Earthly Delights, detests Christmas. The shoppers are frantic and the heat oppressive in Melbourne, Australia, where Christmas is a summer festival. Corinna is a perfect size 20 with a genius for baking bread. And while dreaming of air-conditioned comfort, she finds herself dealing with a rose-addicted donkey named Serena, a maniacal mother with staring eyes, a distracted assistant seeking the definitive glac� cherry recipe, her friend the fearless witch Meroe, and the luscious Daniel with whom she would like to spend a lot more time.</p><p>But Daniel is on the track of two runaways, Brigid and Manny. Their Romeo-and-Juliet romance is not as straightforward as it seems, and the pair will go a long way to avoid being found. With the help of a troupe of free-spirited "freegans," three very clever internet hackers, and a bunch of singing vegans, Corinna and Daniel go head-to-head with a sinister religious cult on a mission and a band of Romanies out for revenge in a wild and wonderful chase against the clock.</p></p><p><p>Kerry Greenwood was born in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray and after wandering far and wide, she returned to live there.

While definitely a minor effort, it fittingly features Eisner's famed creation the Spirit, seldom seen during Eisner's latter years (the Escapist rescues him from archfoe P'Gell). The rest of the stories, which purport to be from various eras of the Escapist's long publishing history but are actually the work of some of today's top comics writers and artists, are the usual mixed bag. Howard Chaykin indulges his affinity for the 1940s with a tale set in occupied Paris, and a contemporary story by Kevin McCarthy and Shawn Martinbrough finds the Escapist battling to free minds in a North Korea-like dictatorship. Most interesting--and illustrative of the admirable anything-goes nature of the series--is alternative cartoonist Jeffrey Brown's depiction of the superhero as a naive romantic drawn in the primitive, awkward style of Brown's disarming autobiographical comics. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But the brilliant chemist's workaholic habits are disrupted when his lover, the former intelligence officer of his company, breaks up with him. Lonely and dispirited, he moves into a new apartment and gets a new phone number that attracts a lot of callers, but not for him. His new telephone number seems to have previously belonged to one Lilly Quinlan, an escort whose Internet photo arouses Henry's curiosity, especially when L.A. Darlings, whose Web page features the beautiful young woman, can't tell Henry how to find her. With the same single-mindedness that made him a high-tech superstar, Pierce pursues his search for the missing girl, motivated by his guilt over the disappearance years earlier of his own sister, who, like Lilly, was also a prostitute (and ultimately the victim of the Dollmaker, a serial killer from Connelly's 1994 novel <i>The Concrete Blonde</i>.) But that motive is too thin to support Pierce's sudden abandonment of his career at such a critical juncture, even if forces unknown to him are setting him up for a fall. Despite those holes in the plot and a less than compelling protagonist, the novel succeeds due to Connelly's literary and expository gifts and his more interesting secondary characters. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Michael Connelly (born July 21, 1956, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is an American author of detective novels, notably those featuring Detective Hieronymus &#34;Harry&#34; Bosch.

The friend, an unsuspecting crane, accomplishes the task quite easily, but is shocked and chagrined when the jackal gobbles them all up and then unexpectedly swallows her, too. When a passing tortoise protests, the jackal sings "Ta ta tortoise," making a snack of the poor reptile. The hungry canine travels through the forest and proceeds to eat every animal who crosses his path, even an elephant. At last, feeling stuffed from his unconventional meal, he lumbers down to the river for a drink of water, where his stomach bursts and everyone tumbles out, rejoicing. The narrative unfolds in cumulative rhyme and is accompanied by distinctive geometric finger paintings created in the ancient Mandna style passed down from mother to daughter. The illustrations are silk screen, printed by hand in black and white. On each page, the jackal grows a little plumper as the crowd of intricately designed animals in his stomach increases. An author's note chronicles the history of the Mandna art form and the genesis of this carefully crafted picture book.

It requires us to <i>be</i> who we are.&#x201d; Social scientist Bren� Brown, PhD, LMSW, has sparked a global conversation about the experiences that bring meaning to our lives&#x2014;experiences of courage, vulnerability, love, belonging, shame, and empathy. In <i>Braving the Wilderness,</i> Brown redefines what it means to truly belong in an age of increased polarization. With her trademark mix of research, storytelling, and honesty, Brown will again change the cultural conversation while mapping a clear path to true belonging.<br><br> Brown argues that we&#x2019;re experiencing a spiritual crisis of disconnection, and introduces four practices of true belonging that challenge everything we believe about ourselves and each other. She writes, &#x201c;True belonging requires us to believe in and belong to ourselves so fully that we can find sacredness both in being a part of something and in standing alone when necessary. But in a culture that&#x2019;s rife with perfectionism and pleasing, and with the erosion of civility, it&#x2019;s easy to stay quiet, hide in our ideological bunkers, or fit in rather than show up as our true selves and brave the wilderness of uncertainty and criticism. But true belonging is not something we negotiate or accomplish with others; it&#x2019;s a daily practice that demands integrity and authenticity. It&#x2019;s a personal commitment that we carry in our hearts.&#x201d; Brown offers us the clarity and courage we need to find our way back to ourselves and to each other. And that path cuts right through the wilderness. Brown writes, &#x201c;The wilderness is an untamed, unpredictable place of solitude and searching. It is a place as dangerous as it is breathtaking, a place as sought after as it is feared. But it turns out to be the place of true belonging, and it&#x2019;s the bravest and most sacred place you will ever stand.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Bren� Brown, PhD, LMSW,</b>&nbsp;is a research professor at the University of Houston, where she holds the Huffington Foundation&#x2013;Bren� Brown Endowed Chair at the Graduate College of Social Work. She has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy and is the author of four #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers:&nbsp;<i>Braving the Wilderness, Rising Strong, Daring Greatly,&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;The Gifts of Imperfection</i>.

And it&#x2019;s especially true when I notice that findings from my research are going to challenge long-�held beliefs or ideas. When this happens, it doesn&#x2019;t take long before I start thinking, Who am I to say this? Or, I&#x2019;m really going to piss people off if I call their ideas into question.<br><br>In these uncertain and risky moments of vulnerability, I search for inspiration from the brave innovators and disrupters whose courage feels contagious. I read and watch everything by them or about them that I can get my hands on&#x2014;�every interview, every essay, every lecture, every book. I do this so that when I need them, when I&#x2019;m living in my fear, they come to sit with me and cheer me on. Most important, while watching over my shoulder, they put up with very little of my bullshit.<br><br>Developing this process took time. In my earlier years, I tried the opposite approach&#x2014;�filling my mind with critics and naysayers. I would sit at my desk and picture the faces of my least favorite professors, my harshest and most cynical colleagues, and my most unforgiving online critics. If I can keep them happy, I thought, or at the very least quiet, I&#x2019;ll be good to go. The outcome was the worst-�case scenario for a researcher or a social scientist: findings that were gently folded into a preexisting way of seeing the world; findings that carefully nudged existing ideas but did so without upsetting anyone; findings that were safe, filtered, and comfortable. But none of that was authentic. It was a tribute.<br><br>So I decided that I had to fire those naysayers and fearmongers. In their places, I began to summon up men and women who have shaped the world with their courage and creativity. And who have, at least on occasion, pissed people off. They are a varied bunch. J. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter books I love so much, is my go-�to person when I&#x2019;m struggling with how to introduce a new and strange world of ideas that has only just emerged from my research. I imagine her telling me: New worlds are important, but you can&#x2019;t just describe them. Give us the stories that make up that universe. No matter how wild and weird the new world might be, we&#x2019;ll see ourselves in the stories.<br><br>The author and activist bell hooks comes to the fore when there&#x2019;s a painful conversation happening around race, gender, or class. She&#x2019;s taught me about teaching as a sacred act and the importance of discomfort in learning. And Ed Catmull, Shonda Rhimes, and Ken Burns stand behind me, whispering in my ear, while I&#x2019;m telling a story. They nudge me when I become impatient and start skipping the details and dialogue that bring meaning to storytelling. &#x201c;Take us with you into that story,&#x201d; they insist. Countless musicians and artists also show up, as does Oprah. Her advice is tacked to the wall in my study: &#x201c;Do not think you can be brave with your life and your work and never disappoint anyone. It doesn&#x2019;t work that way.&#x201d;<br><br>But my oldest and most steadfast counselor is Maya Angelou. I was introduced to her work thirty-�two years ago when I was studying poetry in college. I read her poem &#x201c;Still I Rise&#x201d; and everything shifted for me. It contained such power and beauty. I collected every Angelou book, poem, and interview I could find, and her words taught me, pushed me, and healed me. She managed to be both full of joy and unsparing.<br><br>But there was one quote from Maya Angelou that I deeply disagreed with. It was a quote on belonging, which I came across when I was teaching a course on race and class at the University of Houston. In an interview with Bill Moyers that aired on public television in 1973, Dr. Angelou said:<br><br>You are only free when you realize you belong no place&#x2014;�you belong every place&#x2014;�no place at all. The price is high. The reward is great.<br><br>I can remember exactly what I thought when I read that quote. That&#x2019;s just wrong. What kind of world would it be if we belonged nowhere? Just a bunch of lonely people coexisting. I don&#x2019;t think she understands the power of belonging.<br><br>For over twenty years, whenever that quote popped up in my life, I felt a rush of anger. Why would she say that? That&#x2019;s not true. Belonging is essential. We must belong to something, to someone, to somewhere. I soon realized that the anger came from two places. First, Dr. Angelou had come to mean so much to me that I just couldn&#x2019;t stand the thought that we disagreed on something so fundamental. Second, the need to fit in and the ache of not belonging was one of the most painful threads in my own life. I couldn&#x2019;t accept the idea of &#x201c;belonging nowhere&#x201d; as freedom. Feeling like I never truly belonged anywhere was my greatest pain, a personal suffering that threaded through most of my pre-�adult life.<br><br>It was in no way my liberation.<br><br>Experiences of not belonging are the time markers of my life, and they started early. I attended pre-�K and kindergarten at Paul Habans Elementary on the west bank of New Orleans. It was 1969, and as wonderful as the city was and still is, it was a place suffocated by racism. Schools had only become officially desegregated the year I started. I didn&#x2019;t know or understand much about what was happening, I was too young; but I knew that my mom was outspoken and tenacious. She spoke up a lot and even wrote a letter to the Times-�Picayune challenging the legality of what today we&#x2019;d call racial profiling. I could sense that energy around her, but to me, she was still just a volunteer in my homeroom and the person who made me, herself, and my Barbie matching yellow plaid shift dresses.<br><br>We had moved there from Texas, and that had been hard for me. I desperately missed my grandmother, but I was eager to make new friends at school and around our apartment complex. It quickly got complicated, though. Homeroom lists were used to determine everything&#x2014;�from attendance records to birthday party invitations. One day my mom&#x2019;s room-�mother partner waved the list in front of my mom&#x2019;s face and said, &#x201c;Look at all of the black kids on here! Look at these names! They&#x2019;re all named Casandra!&#x201d;<br><br>Huh, my mom thought. Maybe this explained why I was being left out of so many of my white friends&#x2019; parties. My mom goes by her middle name, but her first name is Casandra. My full name on that homeroom list? Casandra Bren� Brown. If you&#x2019;re African American and reading this, you know exactly why white families weren&#x2019;t inviting me over. It&#x2019;s the same reason a group of African American graduate students gave me a card at the end of the semester that said, &#x201c;OK. You really are Bren� Brown.&#x201d; They had signed up for my course on women&#x2019;s issues and almost fell out of their chairs when I walked to my desk at the front of the classroom on the first day of class. One student said, &#x201c;You are not Casandra Bren� Brown?&#x201d; Yes, ma&#x2019;am. It&#x2019;s also why, when I walked into a job interview for a part-�time receptionist at a doctor&#x2019;s office in San Antonio, the woman said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Bren� Brown! Well, what a pleasant surprise!&#x201d; And yes, I walked out of the interview before we sat down.<br><br>The black families were welcoming to me&#x2014;�but their shock was noticeable when I walked through the door. One of my friends told me I was the first white person who had ever been inside their house. That&#x2019;s hard to wrap your head around when you&#x2019;re four years old and you&#x2019;re really there for pin-�the-�tail-�on-�the-�donkey and to eat cake with your friends. As simple as belonging should be in kindergarten, I was already struggling to understand why I felt on the outside of every group.<br><br>The next year we moved to the Garden District so my dad could be closer to Loyola, and I transferred into Holy Name of Jesus. I was an Episcopalian, which made me one of the only non-�Catholic students in my school. Turned out I was the wrong religion, yet another wedge between me and belonging. After a year or two of sitting out, being called out, and sometimes being left out, I was sent to the office, and arrived to find God waiting for me. At least that&#x2019;s who I thought it was. It turned out to be a bishop. He handed me a mimeographed copy of the Nicene Creed and we went through it, line by line. When we were done, he handed me a note to take home to my parents. The note read, &#x201c;Bren� is Catholic now.&#x201d; <br><br>Still, things were relatively good for the next couple of years as I started to get into the groove of my new life in New Orleans, mostly because I had the best BFF in the world&#x2014;�Eleanor. But then came a bunch of big moves. We left New Orleans for Houston when I was in fourth grade. Then we left Houston for Washington, D.C., when I was in sixth grade. Then we left Washington when I was in eighth grade and moved back to Houston. The normal turbulence and awkwardness of middle school was magnified by perpetual &#x201c;new-�girl-�ness.&#x201d; My only saving grace was that during all of these transitions, my parents were in a good place and getting along. This meant that despite the turbulence around me with ever-�changing schools, friends, and adults, home was safe. It even felt like a refuge from the pain of not belonging. When all else failed, I belonged at home, with my family.<br><br>But things started to break. That last move back to Houston was the beginning of the long, miserable end to my parents&#x2019; marriage. And right on top of that chaos, there were the Bearkadettes.<br><br>When we moved back to Houston at the very end of eighth grade there was, thankfully, just enough time to try out for the high school drill team, called the Bearkadettes. This was to be my everything. In a house that was increasingly filled with the muffled sounds of my parents arguing, heard through the walls of my bedroom, that drill team was salvation. Just picture it: lines of girls in white-�fringed blue satin vests and short skirts, all of them wearing uniform wigs, white cowboy boots, small white cowboy hats, and bright red lipstick, strutting into high school football stadiums filled with crowds afraid to leave their seats during halftime lest they miss the high kicks and perfectly choreographed routines. This was my way out, my new, pretty, impeccably ordered refuge.<br><br>Eight years of ballet was plenty to get me through the task of learning the routine, and a two-�week liquid diet got me through the brutal weigh-�in. All of the girls swore by the cabbage soup and water diet. It&#x2019;s hard to think of letting a twelve-�year-�old go on a liquid diet, but for some reason it seemed normal.<br><br>To this day, I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;ve ever wanted anything in my life more than I wanted a place on this drill team. The perfection, precision, and beauty of it would not only offset the growing turmoil at home, but also deliver the holy grail of belonging. I would have a &#x201c;big sis&#x201d; and she would decorate my locker. We&#x2019;d have sleepovers and date football players. For a kid who had seen Grease forty-�five times, I knew this was the beginning of a high school experience that included sudden, spontaneous sing-�alongs and the 1980s version of sock hops.<br><br>And most of all, I would be a part of something that literally did everything together in lockstep. A Bearkadette was belonging personified.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t really have any friends yet, so I was on my own for tryouts. The routine was easy to learn&#x2014;�a jazzy number performed to a big band version of &#x201c;Swanee&#x201d; (you know, the &#x201c;how I love ya, how I love ya&#x201d; one). There was a lot of sliding with jazz hands and an entire section of high kicks. I could kick higher than all of the girls except one dancer named LeeAnne. I practiced so much that I could do that routine in my sleep. I still remember parts of it today.<br><br>Tryout day was terrifying, and I&#x2019;m not sure if it was my nerves or the starvation diet, but I was lightheaded when I woke up, and I stayed that way after my mom dropped me off at the school. Now, as the mother of a teen and a tween, it&#x2019;s a little hard to think of how I had to walk in by myself, surrounded by groups of girls who were piling out of cars and running in together, holding hands. But I soon realized I had a bigger problem than walking in alone.<br><br>All of the girls&#x2014;�and I mean all of the girls&#x2014;�were made up from head to toe. Some were wearing blue satin shorts and gold shirts, and others had blue and gold tank tops with little white skirts. There was every iteration of blue and gold bows that you could imagine. And they were all in full makeup. I had on no makeup, and I was wearing gray cotton shorts over a black leotard. No one had told me that you were supposed to get decked out in school colors. Everyone looked so bright and shiny. I looked like the sad girl whose parents fight a lot.<br><br>I made the weigh-�in with six pounds to spare. Even so, the sight of girls stepping off the scale and running into the locker room weeping traumatized me.<br><br>We wore numbers safety-�pinned to our shirts and danced in groups of five or six. Lightheaded or not, I nailed the routine. I felt pretty confident when my mom picked me up and I went home to wait it out. They would post the numbers later that evening. Those hours in between moved in slow motion.</p><h2>Excalibur Briefing: Explaining Paranormal Phenomena</h2><p>Look into the fascinating and mysterious world of paranormal phenomena and the interaction of mind and matter in terms of the new physics.

Despite many hardships and encounters with grizzly bears, rattlesnakes, and wild rapids, the Corps of Discovery traveled more than 8000 miles and returned triumphantly in the summer of 1806. Among this group was a most unusual member-a Newfoundland dog. As a hunter, retriever, and guard dog, Seaman was a valuable member of the expedition. In this book, he serves as an unusual focus as events unfold. This is a richly detailed and historically accurate account of the expedition, told as dated entries, with clarity and descriptive language. Pringle closely follows and highlights the adventures of Seaman as they appeared in the journals of Lewis and Clark, and the loyalty and devotion he exhibited as he risked his life many times. Selections from their journals appear throughout the story, and Pringle also offers evidence, first discovered in 2000, about what happened to the animal after the expedition came to an end. Intriguing sidebars, maps, historical illustrations, and original art make this a treasure trove of information about the expedition, and the dog that was its most unusual participant.<br><i>Janet Gillen, Great Neck Public Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>God Bless the Child (Coretta Scott King Illustrator Honor Books)</h2><p><p><b></b></p><b>"Mama may have,<br> Papa may have,<br> But God bless the child <br> That's got his own!<br> That's got his own."<br></b><p></p><p>The song "God Bless the Child" was first performed by legendary jazz vocalist Billie Holiday in 1939 and remains one of her enduring masterpieces.

She quickly rose to stardom, and six years later she introduced the world to two of her best-known songs: "Strange Fruit" and "God Bless the Child."

I started drawing as far back as I can remember, at the age of four or five. My brothers drew, and I guess in a way I was mimicking them. I found I enjoyed the act of putting marks on paper. It gave me a way of creating my own space and quiet time, as well as a way of expressing myself. You can imagine six children competing for attention and to be heard. I would sit, watching and drawing.</p><p>"In first grade I had the opportunity to draw a large picture of a fire engine on the blackboard. I was complimented and encouraged to draw more. The attention felt good, and I wanted more. I was not a terrific reader or adept speller in my growing-up years, and I felt insecure in those areas. Drawing helped me build my self-esteem and feel good about myself, and, with hard work, I graduated from elementary school with honors.</p><p>"I attended an all-black elementary school, and I gained a strong sense of self and an appreciation of my own culture there. But Roosevelt Junior High was integrated. There I had many friends, both white and black, at a time when there was little mixing socially in school. There the spark for my curiosity about people was lit. You can see this interest and fascination with people of different cultures throughout my work.</p><p>"My formal art training started at Dobbins Vocational High School, and upon graduation I received a scholarship to the Philadelphia Museum College of Art. My major was advertising and design. The most exciting classes for me were drawing, painting, and printmaking. It is no wonder I turned to illustrating and designing books. For me the book represents the ultimate in graphics: first, as a designer, considering space, page size, number of pages, and type size; then, as an illustrator, dealing with the aesthetics of line, color, and form.</p><p>"There were three books that somehow magically came into my possession in the early sixties: <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>, illustrated by Arthur Rackham; <em>The Wonder Clock</em>, illustrated by Howard Pyle; and <em>Rain Makes Applesauce</em>, illustrated by Marvin Bileck. You can see those influences in my art today. Later, my work was greatly influenced by such African American artists as Charles White, Romare Bearden, and Jacob Lawrence.</p><p>"From the very beginning of my career in illustrating books, research has been important. I do as much as possible on a given subject, so that I live the experience and have a vision of the people and places. To capture a sense of realism for characters in my work, I use models that resemble the people I want to portray. My wife, Gloria Jean (also an author), and I keep a closetful of old clothes to dress up the models, and I have the models act out the story. Photos are taken to aid me in better understanding body language and facial expressions. Once I have that photo in front of me I have freedom, because the more you know, the more you can be inventive.</p><p>"For illustrating stories about animals, I keep a large reference file of over a hundred books on nature and animals. The first step in envisioning a creature is for me to pretend to be that particular animal. I think about its size and the sounds it makes, how it moves (slowly or quickly), and where it lives. I try to capture the feeling of the creature, as well as its true-to-life characteristics. There are times when the stories call for the animals to be anthropomorphic, and I've used photographs of myself posing as the animal characters.</p><p>"It still amazes me how much the projects I have illustrated have given back to me in terms of personal and artistic satisfaction. They have given me the opportunity to use my imagination, to draw, to paint, to travel through the voices of the characters in the stories, and, above all else, to touch children."</p>Kindergarten-Grade 5--A moving visual interpretation of Holiday and Herzog's swing spiritual based on the proverb, "God blessed the child that's got his own." The song serves as the inspiration for Pinkney's depiction of the Great Migration of the 1930s. Through evocative images, the artist tells the story of one family's move north. The warm and sweeping illustrations are masterful, completely filling each spread. Although the pages are rich in detail, the well-composed paintings never seem cluttered or overwhelming. There is something new to attract readers, even after several readings. The sense of the family members as a unit, as well as their emotions of hope, anxiety, and relief, are all beautifully conveyed. A CD of Holiday performing the song is included, and while the book can be enjoyed without it, listening to the nostalgic and somewhat bittersweet music does elicit an emotional response. While a fine choice for independent reading, this title is particularly poignant when shared with a group, turning the pages in conjunction with the CD. An author's note provides background about Pinkney's inspirations and research. This offering makes an excellent tie-in to units on African-American history.--Mary N.

Forming an active link in a chain that reaches back through Ovid&#39;s METAMORPHOSES directly to Homer, Roberto Calasso&#39;s re-exploration of the fantastic fables and mysteries we may only think we know explodes the entire world of Greek mythology, pieces it back together, and presents it to us in a new, and astonishing, and utterly contempory way.</p><p>Already an international literary event, and translated into a dozen languages, The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony is a book without any modern parallel. Forming an active link in a chain that reaches back through Ovid&#39;s Metamorphoses directly to Homer, Roberto Calasso&#39;s reexploration of the fantastic fables we may think we know explodes the entire world of Greek mythology, pieces it back together as it once must have been, and presents it to us in a new astonishing, and utterly contemporary way. &#34;But how did it all begin?&#34; The eternal question that Man has always asked of his universe also forms the opening words of this book. In answer, and in the voice of the born story-teller (all erudition, all interpretation is hidden in the folds of his dazzling narrative), Calasso leads us through the maze, back to the time when the gods were not yet born from the original coupling of Uranus and Ge, Mother Earth; then forward again, all the way to the death of Odysseus, which marks the end of the age of heroes; and - most important of all - to the marriage of Cadmus and Harmony, the last occasion when the gods sat down at a feast with mortal men. That day began a chain of calamities, a streak of blood that parted earth from Olympus forever. What was left - Cadmus&#39;s parting gift to men - was the alphabet, and from it both history and poetry, and so our world, were born. Yet the world of myth is not dead - it is present now as it was in the time of Homer. The most dangerous event since the beginning of time has been the gods&#39; discovery of us, their Olympian fascination with these human creatures that led them first to invade our world, then to assume human form for their own purposes and their ownterrible games. The consequences of that fascination are the extraordinary encounters that we know as the myths - the great, hypnotic, erotic, often contradictory stories that Calasso walks us back into as if they are some vast, half-ruined palace we had forgotten we owned. At the end, the gods abandoned the world. But the multifaceted psychology of modern man and his atemporal sense of time have brought him closer than ever to the mythic condition. And as the author reminds us, the gods - now as then - do not ask to be believed; they ask only to be recognized. &#34;These things never happened, but they are always&#34;. Roberto Calasso&#39;s book transforms our relationship to the wellsprings of our culture.Presenting the stories of Zeus and Europa, Theseus and Ariadne, the birth of Athens and the fall of Troy, in all their variants, Calasso also uncovers the distant origins of secrets and tragedy, virginity, and rape. &#34;A perfect work like no other.

Jeremy Black offers a historian&#x2019;s interpretation from the perspective of the late 2010s, assessing James Bond in terms of the greatly changing world order of the Bond years&#x2014;a lifetime that stretches from 1953, when the first novel appeared, to the present. Black argues that the Bond novels&#x2014;the Fleming books as well as the often-neglected novels authored by others after Fleming died in 1964&#x2014;and films drew on current fears in order to reduce the implausibility of the villains and their villainy.<br>The novels and films also presented potent images of national character, explored the rapidly changing relationship between a declining Britain and an ascendant United States, charted the course of the Cold War and the subsequent post-1990 world, and offered an evolving but always potent demonology. Bond was, and still is, an important aspect of post&#x2013;World War II popular culture throughout the Western world. This was particularly so after Hollywood launched the filmic Bond, thus making him not only a character designed for the American film market but also a world product and a figure of globalization. Class, place, gender, violence, sex, race&#x2014;all are themes that Black scrutinizes through the ongoing shifts in characterization and plot. His well-informed and well-argued analysis provides a fascinating history of the enduring and evolving appeal of James Bond.</p><p>Jeremy Black graduated from Cambridge University with a Starred First and did graduate work at Oxford University before teaching at the University of Durham and then at the University of Exeter, where he is professor of history. He has held visiting chairs at the United States Military Academy at West Point, Texas Christian University, and Stillman College. He is a 2018 Templeton Fellow of the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Black received the Samuel Eliot Morison Prize from the Society for Military History in 2008. His recent books include Naval Warfare: A Global History since 1860, Insurgency and Counterinsurgency: A Global History, and Air Power: A Global History.Black, a British military historian, considers James Bond&#x2019;s various print and screen incarnations and the villains he has fought over the years from a historical perspective. Introduced to the public in the 1953 novel Casino Royale, Bond was the creation of Ian Fleming, an officer in British naval intelligence during WWII. When the series began, Britain was still an imperial power, Churchill was again prime minister, and the Cold War was underway. Black shows that the ensuing books, and the films that came later, were informed by changing world politics. The villains, whether the Communist Le Chiffre in the novel (but not the screen versions of) Casino Royale, the mafia in Diamonds Are Forever (1971), or the rogue agent of the post&#x2013;Cold War GoldenEye (1995), reflected contemporary fears. Black places more emphasis on the films than on the novels, aptly comparing the former to a 'very good meal that you already know and love.' Black&#x2019;s analysis of how a succession of writers and actors have presented Bond over the years goes well beyond being a literary or film retrospective by incorporating sociopolitical grace notes. His survey, which includes a brief piece on how Trump&#x2019;s America might influence the franchise, serves as a thoughtful and uniquely positioned consideration of shifting cultural currents over the last seven decades. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>The world of James Bond, the author tells us, is one of shifting political and moral realities. Bond, a Cold War spy when he first appeared in literary form in the 1950s, has been faced with some major cultural upheavals (particularly in the 1960s); the challenge, for Bond creator Ian Fleming and for the filmmakers and novelists who have continued telling Bond stories after Fleming&#x2019;s death, was to allow Bond to adapt to changes in his world while remaining essentially the same person. The most notable change in the Bond series, especially in the movies, was the shift from realism to larger-than-life spectacle; the evil and completely fictional SPECTRE, for example, replaced Fleming&#x2019;s original villainous spy organization, SMERSH, which had been based on a real Russian intelligence group.... [T]his is a worthy addition to the ever-growing literature about the world&#x2019;s most famous superspy. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>The World of James Bond is a very important study of James Bond, one of the most important literary characters invented during the World War II, and some other lesser known spy characters. Understanding the character of British super spy 007 is like understanding the Cold War. With his impeccable academic credentials, Jeremy Black helps us understand the super spy most of us loved for more than half a century. Many of us still love James Bond. Understanding super spy 007 is also important because we may again slip back into another Cold War era. (<i>The Washington BookReview</i>)<br><br>Fans of James Bond must get hold of this superb book by distinguished historian Jeremy Black. Black explores the enduring global fascination with Ian Fleming&#x2019;s incredible creation, the legendary superspy 007, who comes to the defense of the Britons in this most recent dangerous dark age. With insight and flair, Black relates the Bond books and movies produced over the past sixty years to today&#x2019;s kaleidoscopic real-world nightmares of superpower confrontation and international terrorism.

He lives a dissolute existence in a tiny apartment with three (sometimes four) slacker roommates, holds a mind-numbing job at the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, and has a chronic inability to make up his mind. Encouraged by one of his roommates to try an experimental drug meant to banish indecision, Dwight jumps at the chance (not without some vacillation about the hazards of jumping) and swallows the first fateful pill. And when all at once he is &#x201c;pfired&#x201d; by Pfizer and invited to a rendezvous in exotic Ecuador with the girl of his long-ago prep-school dreams, he finds himself on the brink of a new life. The trouble&#x2013;well, one of the troubles&#x2013;is that Dwight can&#x2019;t decide if the pills are working.

He has written for <i>Dissent</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, and the <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, and is a founding editor of <i>n+1 magazine</i>.ONE<br>A week before Quito I was sitting up in bed in New York, the edges of my awareness lapped at by traffic. I was sitting there with one hand holding open the book I was reading, and the other hand placed above the head of sleeping Vaneetha. There I was, pinned in space and time like a specimen in a box.<br><br>Vaneetha had turned away and slid down the bed so that nothing of her was visible except for the dark disheveled Vaneethian hair from which the lamplight was extracting all these twisting strings of a greenish iridescence. I wouldn&#x2019;t have figured that even the darkest hair could react to light in this way, and the discovery blinked in my mind as just the smallest, quietest symbol of the multiple discoveries that could still be made between us if we&#x2013;unless it was mostly me&#x2013;weren&#x2019;t so ambivalent about making them.<br><br>Once a week had become more like two times, and on our nights together I was usually awake like this for an hour or so while Vaneetha slept and breathed beside me. Sometimes she&#x2019;d twitch like a dreaming dog, and in part due to my intense feeling for dogs, shared by my entire family, this would induce a shiver of tenderness in me. Yet exactly because I experienced this tenderness I wondered if I shouldn&#x2019;t stop showing it when we were both awake. It could lead to us feeling, harmfully, that we were together. And as our relationship was predicated on not wanting to be in a relationship yet, that seemed unlike the best idea. We were both in agreement that contemporary courtship was far too accelerated these days. That was how Vaneetha explained why she&#x2019;d had so few partners, and how I explained why I&#x2019;d had seventeen or more. Nevertheless it eventually became up-in-the-air and unspoken whether we were sleeping together brother-sister style and mostly refraining from outright sex except when drunk because a) we weren&#x2019;t courting each other or <br>b) we were, only slowly, just as these things should be done and never are.<br><br>In any case it often seemed at night that I would make a better dog owner than boyfriend. It wasn&#x2019;t apparent to me how best to treat Vaneetha, each woman being so different. Whereas every dog, in spite of the really incredible variety of the species, required more or less the same regimen of food and water, walks and affectionate pats on the head. However in the city it actually exacted a lot less responsibility to have a girlfriend than a dog. And I really wanted one or the other, since like any person, or dog, I too craved affection. Hmn.<br><br>It was almost a type of peace to arrive each night at the same mental impasse. Plus I felt at home in the quiet, like a local. I was sensitive and weirdly sympathetic to that moment when the refrigerator kicked in and began to hum. Then the groans of a garbage truck would as much confirm as interrupt the hush. And there was the bonus sensation of authority I got as the last one up, the presiding mind.<br><br>So I would return to certain issues like hands to a notch on the clock. It would always dawn on me, late at night, that life is made of days&#x2013;and your life isn&#x2019;t likely to pick up whatever your days pass by. Granted, this was really a postmortem analysis of the given day, carried out when it was already yesterday or tomorrow, depending on point of view. If it was one of the nights that Ford (roommate one) and his girlfriend Kat were spending downtown with us, they would have finished giving one another the business to the accompaniment of frightened bedsprings. <br><br>And if it was past two then Sanchez (roommate two) would have gotten up out of his humid sleep to shut off the TV he&#x2019;d equipped with a hot cable box transmitting pirated pay-per-view sporting events, feature films, and porn in an endless jostling stream. And Dan (roommate three) might or might not be around, since more and more he moved very quietly through the world, subsisting on snacks and growing thin and spiritual and haunted-looking, and only occasionally briefing us between classes and lab at NYU med school on what he was learning there. Lately he&#x2019;d expressed the opinion that general uremia must be the least painful way to go in the end, and had assured me and Sanch that there was little to no scientific evidence linking coffee, even my six cups daily, with cancer.<br><br>Sanch said, &#x201c;Yeah man fucking Hugo Ch�vez drinks sixteen espressos a day. And that&#x2019;s after his staff weaned him down from twenty-four.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Amazing!&#x201d; I was really impressed with this man. &#x201c;Who is Hugo Ch�vez?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s, like, a revolutionary.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sounds like it,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>Sometimes Dan could be found in his room poring over a textbook while listening through his headphones to terrifying music by Austro-Hungarian composers. But his whereabouts were erratic, or I couldn&#x2019;t do the algorithm, and anyway he stayed with us only due to low rent. It wouldn&#x2019;t have been so low if the walls to our rooms had gone all the way up to the ceiling. Instead we lived in pasteboard cubicles and weird dorm-style intimacy&#x2013;which kind of enforced an obscurish connection between my home life and my days at Pfizer, where the cubicle was also the unit.<br><br>Anyway Ford, Sanch, Dan, me&#x2013;that was Chambers St., and was going to be for five more weeks, until our lease ran out. Other friends lived scattered around the city in ones and twos, and this had allowed us four to provide, in the welcoming squalor of our living room, a kind of community center for the school-days diasporae. Poker was played, friends were entertained, TV got watched and color-commentated. Out of everybody we knew our immaturity was best-preserved, we dressed worst and succeeded least professionally&#x2013;and at times I could get into feeling that for the old crowd to set foot on the scarred linoleum of our kitchen must be like entering this circling, slow eddy in the otherwise one-way flow of time. Outside was the streaming traffic, the money bazaar, the trash-distributing winds with their careerist velocities. And here inside Chambers St. was this cozy set of underachievers. We even had a fireplace, though it didn&#x2019;t work, and housed the stereo instead. At times I gained control of the remote, and the drowned-sounding post-human electronica that was our usual aural wallpaper, making me feel like words might not apply to our condition, and freaking me out if I got stoned, was replaced by the bright fine stylings of the Grateful Dead, just as if Jerry&#x2019;d never died.<br><br>But Jerry had died. And soon our lease would be up! And so would I end and die too! I tried not to be reminded of the eternal endingness of everything by Ground Zero down the street. I really preferred for the reminder to come, more gently, from philosopher Otto Knittel. In the months before Ecuador I was all about The Uses of Freedom&#x2013;or Der Gebrauch der Freiheit if you&#x2019;re German. Late at night I would look at the words of this very deathocentric book, and on that Saturday night with Vaneetha (which had so far failed to distinguish itself from many of the Saturday nights preceding it) I was looking again at the words, with one eye open and the other shut since I&#x2019;d taken out my contacts and otherwise couldn&#x2019;t focus on the lines. &#x201c;Procrastination is our substitute for immortality,&#x201d; went the first half of the sentence I was rereading; &#x201c;we behave as if we have no shortage of time.&#x201d; I read the book at maybe two pages an hour.<br><br>Yet I felt more slow than stupid, and suspected it had always been thus with me. Maybe my slow temporal metabolism wasn&#x2019;t equipped for the efficient digestion of modern&#x2013;or postmodern&#x2013;life, as it had apparently already been for some time. Sometimes I felt like I&#x2019;d never catch up with even the little that had happened to me. There had already been too many people and places, and the creaking stagecoach journey or straggling canoe ride by which one location might observe, in olden times, how it became the next (and one Dwight, the next, uncannily similar Dwight) had been supplanted by the sleight of hand of subways and airplanes, always popping you out in unexpected places.<br><br>At least at night the phone didn&#x2019;t ring. My feeling was, the soul is startled by the telephone and never at ease in its presence. Often on a midtown street someone&#x2019;s cell would ring and half a dozen people would check their pockets to see if it was them being called, and I&#x2019;d glimpse a flash of panic in one or another guy&#x2019;s eyes. Myself, I kind of felt like I needed my news delivered by hand&#x2013;to look out the window as some courier appeared in the field, coming from a distance so my feelings had time to discover themselves. But instead people were always calling and asking me to do things, and since only pretty rarely was I really sure I wanted to, my system was to flip a coin. &#x201c;Hold on let me check my . . . yeah sounds cool but hold on . . .&#x201d; I would say in the Chambers St. kitchen or if someone called at work. But I didn&#x2019;t have a date book and was actually consulting one of the special coins. Heads, I&#x2019;d accept&#x2013;whereas tails, I&#x2019;d claim to have other plans. I was proud of this system. Statistically fair, it also kept my whole easy nature from forcing me to do everyone&#x2019;s bidding; it ensured a certain scarcity of Dwightness on the market; it contributed the prestige of the inscrutable to my otherwise transparent persona; and above all it allowed me to find out in my own good time whether I would actually have liked to do the thing in question. By then it was invariably too late&#x2013;but everyone agrees that knowledge is its own reward, and so do I.<br><br>A night alone meant I could get a jump on The Uses of Freedom. At this rate there was every possibility of my finishing inside of the year. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you just write the thing,&#x201d; Dan said. &#x201c;It would probably be faster.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But how would I ever come up with Der Unternehmungsgrund der Individuums on my own?&#x201d;<br><br>When I first read about this ground for the individual&#x2019;s action, I could at last put an unwieldy and foreign name to what I had felt had been missing from my life ever since puberty struck and my prep-school days commenced, more or less at once, and I&#x2019;d begun to proceed unsteadily from day to day as if I were on a bridge swaying in the wind while both sides of the canyon&#x2013;I mean past and future&#x2013;disappeared in foggy weather. Suddenly I&#x2019;d lost the sensation of there being either a source or an end to my life, an original birth or ultimate death, and was therefore amazed at how everyone seemed to consider me a solid reliable young man. Otto Knittel, I was learning as a much older young man, was way into forests, so while reading him I would imagine decamping from the city and going to live in the woods in Vermont. With a dog. Or several dogs. The idea was to inhabit a cabin, baking bread and hardly even watching TV, petting and talking to the dog, or dogs, and drinking tea instead of so much coffee. Sunlight, wide floorboards, caller ID for the phone . . . And old friends from the city could drive up to admire my aura of wisdom and calm benevolence that I would be too egoless even to notice. I felt that in these circumstances the ground for my actions might sort of percolate up through me in this slow molten way, and a prayerful clarity of consciousness would finally pop into my brain. Then I would know what to do. Then I could return to New York, and do it.<br><br>But in the smaller of the hours I could get to feeling bad that I hadn&#x2019;t even looked into doing &#x201c;it&#x201d; yet. And the feeling was worse if the night ended with the warm smooth length of Vaneetha at my side, as she slept and breathed beneath my not-so-clean cotton sheets. There were starting to be signs that a serious attachment to me had been formed, by her, so that not only would I need to slip out of the city to go let my truer understandings avail themselves of me&#x2013;I&#x2019;d also have to extricate myself from someone else&#x2019;s life.<br><br>One good thing was that at least I didn&#x2019;t have a lot of furniture to take. However first I would need to find a town in Vermont, and a job there. Yet I was full of hope that the new information-based economy might really spell the end of geography and I could do tech support from the woods. Then again this hopefulness was so 1999, and now it was May 2002&#x2013;late May already. In any case I had a to-do list (more a list of good intentions) and before finally going to sleep I would get up to write down&#x2013;after GROCERIES! or MOM RE: CHURCH!! or VANEETHA? or PAPER TOWELS or COST OF SHRINKS?&#x2013;LOOK INTO VT. OPTIONS.<br><br>So it would be late at night before I fell asleep. But don&#x2019;t worry: I got plenty of sleep. Not only was I an excellent sleeper, but I had no functioning alarm clock to disrupt my Cimmerian rhythms. Of course when the relevant button broke off, I&#x2019;d put it on my list to get another clock. But then at work they&#x2013;or Rick, the manager&#x2013;made an announcement, which was that although we who worked at Pfizer in the Problem Resolution Center were already only subcontracted, we were still considered in house for the fairly inarguable reason that our office was housed in Pfizer headquarters. Soon some guys in Mumbai, India, were going to be doing our work for less of our pay. &#x201c;You sayin we getting outsourced here?&#x201d; my colleague Wanda asked. Rick was saying that, and adding this sick little smile all his own.<br><br>The effect on morale was not good. In my case I saw that globalization was for real and declined to replace my alarm clock. What did I have to get up for if my days at Pfizer were numbered anyway? Now I usually just woke around ten, yawning and stretching, replenished with ignorance. Work was officially beginning but I would go out and get an everything bagel&#x2013;impossible, otherwise, to choose&#x2013;and come back and toast the halves and slather one with pesto and the other with Nutella. Yum.<br><br>So far my main accommodation to Vaneetha-Dwight domesticity was to keep little jars of both condiments at her place in Carroll Gardens. &#x201c;I still can&#x2019;t believe what you&#x2019;ll put in your mouth.&#x201d; Her dad&#x2019;s various ambassadorial postings had caused her to be educated in British-run schools, and she pronounced can&#x2019;t like as in philosopher Immanuel Kant. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m touched you&#x2019;re moving in, after your fashion.&#x201d; Morningtime fun could be had if she was game and would feed me a mystery bagel half while my eyes were closed. &#x201c;To have no idea,&#x201d; I would say, &#x201c;when both options are so equally good!&#x201d;<br><br>Then I rode the F train, if from Vaneetha&#x2019;s place, or took the <br>2/3 to Forty-second, and on the way would look at The Uses of <br>Freedom&#x2013;such a different book in the daylight, and so much less credible.</p><h2>The Wisdom of Teams: Creating the High-Performance Organization (Collins Business Essentials)</h2><p>Teams -- the key to top performance Motorola relied heavily on teams to surpass its competition in building the lightest, smallest, and highest-quality cell phones. At 3M, teams are critical to meeting the company's goal of producing half of each year's revenues from the previous five years' innovations. Kodak's Zebra Team proved the worth of black-and-white film manufacturing in a world where color is king.<p></p> But many companies overtook the potential of teams in turning around tagging profits, entering new markets, and making exciting innovations happen -- because they don't know how to utilize teams successfully. Authors Jon R. Katzenbach and Douglas K. Smith talked with hundreds of people in more than thirty companies to find out where and how teams work best and how to enhance their effectiveness. They reveal:<p></p> <ul> <li>The most important element in team success</li><p></p> <li>Who excels at team leadership . . . and why they are rarely the most senior people </li><p></p> <li>Why companywide change depends on teams . . . and more</li></ul><p></p> Comprehensive and proven effective, <em>The Wisdom of Teams</em> is the classic primer on making teams a powerful tool for success in today's global marketplace.<p></p></p><p><p>Jon R.

Mr. Katzenbach and Mr. Smith are both formerly of McKinsey &amp; Company.</p>The importance of teams has become a cliche of modern business theory, but few have a clear idea of what it means. In this new edition of their best-selling primer, Katzenbach and Smith try to impart some analytical rigor to the concept. Drawing on their experience as management consultants and a plethora of case studies at companies like Burlington Northern and Motorola, they cover such topics as the optimal size of teams, coping with turnover in team personnel and nurturing "extraordinary teams" rather than "pseudo-teams." Reacting against the touchy-feely interpersonal bent of discourse on teams, they emphasize hard-nosed principles of "performance, focus, and discipline," over the softer concerns of "communication, openness and 'chemistry.'" Teams, they argue, gel and achieve not by developing "togetherness," but by tackling and surmounting specific "outcome-based" challenges ("eliminate all late deliveries...within 90 days" rather than the vaguer "develop a plan for improving customer satisfaction."). Some of the authors' recommendations are reasonably precise and practical, but too many are nebulous truisms ("keep the purpose, goals, and approach relevant and meaningful") or weighed down by turgid consultant-ese ("integrating the performance goals of formal, structural units as well as special ad hoc group efforts becomes a significant process design challenge"). The case studies are better written, but it's not clear that these inspiring anecdotes of team triumph add up to a systematic doctrine. The book leaves the impression that teams ultimately just have to learn by doing. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>In Search of Genghis Khan</h2><p>Retraces the tracks of Genghis Khan&#39;s horde as they established history&#39;s largest empire, tells of the legends surrounding the Great Khan&#39;s life, and explains how Mongolian culture has changed little since the Middle Ages</p><p>Explorer and author <b>Tim Severin</b> is the author of numerous books including <i> In Search of Robinson Crusoe</i> (ISBN: 046507698X), <i>The Brendan Voyage</i> (ISBN: 0375755241), and <i>In Search of Moby Dick</i> (ISBN : 030681045X). A regular contributor to <i>National Geographic</i>, he lives in County Cork, Ireland.Reflecting that peculiarly British enthusiasm for travel and adventure in distant and usually inclement climes, veteran writer and traveler Severin (Tracking Marco Polo, 1986, etc.) went to Mongolia ``to see how much of the traditional way of life survived.'' Having written a thesis at Oxford on the first Europeans to venture into Central Asia during the great Mongol Empires of the 13th and 14th centuries, Severin was delighted when asked in the late 1980's to visit Mongolia. Once closed to Westerners, the country was now, with the collapse of Communism, welcoming Occidental visitors. The authorities were particularly interested in Severin participating in a projected, but subsequently deferred, epic ride on Mongolian horses to mark the 800th birthday of Genghis Khan. This ride would replicate journeys that Mongolian couriers regularly made in the Middle Ages from Mongolia to France. On his two visits to Mongolia, Severin visited the remote birthplace of Genghis Khan; traveled with Mongolian nomads on horseback over part of the conqueror's route through the mountainous regions of this large but thinly populated country, where summer is brief and winter brutal; encountered a plague-ridden marmot in a region where bubonic plague is endemic, confirming his belief that the Mongols were responsible for introducing the devastating disease to Europe; and met an ancient shaman whose existence testified to the continuing legacy of Genghis Khan. Ultimately, Severin concluded that, despite nearly 70 years of Communist rule, much of the old ways still remain. Rich in information and insight: a vivid portrait of a little- known people who, once the scourge of Europe, rode--on the remarkable horses whose descendants they still ride today--in pursuit of empire as far as the outer gates of Vienna.

It endorses extermination of witches and for this purpose develops a detailed legal and theological theory. It was a bestseller, second only to the Bible in terms of sales for almost 200 years. It was written by the Catholic clergyman Heinrich Kramer and first published in 1487. The Malleus elevates sorcery to the criminal status of heresy and prescribes inquisitorial practices for secular courts in order to extirpate witches. The recommended procedures include torture to effectively obtain confessions and the death penalty as the only sure remedy against the evils of witchcraft. At that time, it was typical to burn heretics alive at the stake and the Malleus encouraged the same treatment of witches. The book had a strong influence on culture for several centuries. It was later used by royal courts during the Renaissance, and contributed to the increasingly brutal prosecution of witchcraft during the 16th and 17th centuries.</p><p></p><h2>Aneesa Lee and the Weaver&#39;s Gift</h2><p>Thirteen interrelated poems and as many radiant illustrations create not only a celebration of the ancient art of weaving but a joyful exploration of how love and hard work can mesh separate threads--or separate people--into a harmonious whole.</p><p><p>Nikki Grimes began penning poetry at the age of six. Her many award-winning titles include the picture books <em>Talkin' About Bessie: The Story of Aviator Elizabeth Coleman</em>, which won the Coretta Scott King Illustrator Award and a Coretta Scott King Author Honor, and <em>Meet Danitra Brown</em>, which won a Coretta Scott King Illustrator Honor. Coretta Scott King Author Honors went to her novels <em>The Road to Paris</em>, <em>Jazmin's Notebook</em>, and <em>Dark Sons</em>, and her novel <em>Bronx Masquerade</em> won the Coretta Scott King Author Award. She lives in Corona, California. </p>In a series of thoughtful, interlocking poems, Grimes (Meet Danitra Brown) skillfully uses the metaphor of weaving to explore the world of a talented girl. The young weaver's strands of black, white and Japanese heritage have "produced a pleasing,/ living, breathing tapestry/ christened Aneesa Lee." The poet reveals Aneesa Lee's life and thoughts through the intricate patterns of her work ("a herringbone of sadness,/ threads of anger and gladness"; "Her yarns express her deepest thoughts/ in variegated tints"). The themes of the bookAfamily, community, artistic vision, dedication to craft and loveAbuild to a resonant climax in the last poem where Grimes suggests that, "From the age of bronze/ To the age of space,/ From Ankara to Zanzibar,/.../ The loom connects us all/ In a community/ Of cloth." Bryan's (Beat the Story Drum, Pum-Pum) sweeping tempera and gouache illustrations include all the shades of yarn that Aneesa Lee enumerates, as well as a cast of many colors. His paintings reflect the many moods of the poems, each framed in a vibrant textile pattern. A list of terms integral to the craft will aid novices. For adult weavers, the book will be a treasure, and for children, it serves as a glimpse into the intricacies not only of weaving, but the patterns of daily life. Ages 7-up.

His account provides a useful companion to The Stranger for students and general readers.</p><p><i>The Stranger</i> is not merely one of the most widely read novels of the 20th century, but one of the books likely to outlive it. Written in 1946, Camus's compelling and troubling tale of a disaffected, apparently amoral young man has earned a durable popularity (and remains a staple of U.S. high school literature courses) in part because it reveals so vividly the anxieties of its time. Alienation, the fear of anonymity, spiritual doubt--all could have been given a purely modern inflection in the hands of a lesser talent than Camus, who won the Nobel Prize in 1957 and was noted for his existentialist aesthetic. The remarkable trick of <i>The Stranger</i>, however, is that it's not mired in period philosophy.<p> The plot is simple. A young Algerian, Meursault, afflicted with a sort of aimless inertia, becomes embroiled in the petty intrigues of a local pimp and, somewhat inexplicably, ends up killing a man. Once he's imprisoned and eventually brought to trial, his crime, it becomes apparent, is not so much the arguably defensible murder he has committed as it is his deficient character. The trial's proceedings are absurd, a parsing of incidental trivialities--that Meursault, for instance, seemed unmoved by his own mother's death and then attended a comic movie the evening after her funeral are two ostensibly damning facts--so that the eventual sentence the jury issues is both ridiculous and inevitable.</p><p> Meursault remains a cipher nearly to the story's end--dispassionate, clinical, disengaged from his own emotions. "She wanted to know if I loved her," he says of his girlfriend. "I answered the same way I had the last time, that it didn't mean anything but that I probably didn't." There's a latent ominousness in such observations, a sense that devotion is nothing more than self-delusion. It's undoubtedly true that Meursault exhibits an extreme of resignation; however, his confrontation with "the gentle indifference of the world" remains as compelling as it was when Camus first recounted it. <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p>Through the story of an ordinary man unwittingly drawn into a senseless murder on an Algerian beach, Camus explored what he termed &#34;the nakedness of man faced with the absurd.&#34; First published in 1946; now in a new translation by Matthew Ward.</p><h2>Great Pyrenees (Comprehensive Owner&#39;s Guide)</h2><p>Traces the history of the breed, describes breed standards, discusses care and grooming requirements, and includes information on training.</p><p></p><h2>Building Bridges: Christianity and Islam</h2><p>Building Bridges provides personal experiences based on a lifetime of understanding the Arab world as well as research and analysis of the texts of the Qur&#x2019;an and the Bible to show the similarities between the two.<br><br>This book supplies the information, concrete examples, and insights necessary when dialoguing with Muslims.</p><p>BUILDING BRIDGES BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND ISLAM. Muslims and Christians both worship one God. In fact, they have much in common. Although the history between Muslims and Christian has been strained at best, it doesn&#x2019;t have to be that way. There are many areas of common ground between the two faiths, providing ample opportunity to build relationships. Fouad Accad grew up in Lebanon and spent most of his life there building bridges between individual followers of Christianity and followers of Islam. His passion was to bring two communities together-Muslim and Christian. What Accad built were bridges of understanding, communication, and love. Building Bridges provides personal experiences based on a lifetime of understanding the Arab world as well as research and analysis of the texts of the Qur&#x2019;an and the Bible to show the similarities between the two. This book supplies readers with the information, concrete examples, and insights necessary when dialoguing with Muslims. If you want to reach out to Muslims around you, Building Bridges will equip you to build relationships of mutual respect and trust.Linda Dillow is the author or coauthor of numerous best-selling books, including A Deeper Kind of Calm, Calm My Anxious Heart, Creative Counterpart, Intimate Issues, and Intimacy Ignited.

So begins the saga of Francesca Spinelli, the hilarious and achingly real creation of Aussie author Melina Marchetta. Francesca used to think her biggest problem was transferring to St. Sebastian's--a school only recently turned coed: "What a dream come true, right? Seven hundred and fifty boys and thirty girls? But the reality is that it's either like living in a fish bowl or like you don't exist." But now there's this matter of her usually vibrant and annoyingly optimistic mother Mia refusing to get up in the morning. Her taciturn father doesn't have much to say on the subject, her beloved little brother Luca is anxiously looking to her for answers, and her so-called friends from her old neighborhood seem to have abandoned her. So, Francesca keeps it all inside--her frustration with school (there aren't enough girl's bathrooms and no girl's sports teams); her fear making new friends (with the few girls who do go to St. Sebastian's); and her overwhelming hatred of the smug Will Trombal, who despite being completely infuriating, is also incredibly cute. Keeping this to herself when all she wants to do is spill it to her mother is killing Francesca, but with Mia trying to make herself well again, Francesca will have to figure out how to save herself. <p> What makes <i>Saving Francesca</i> an exceptional standout in a vast field of mediocre teen chick lit is Frankie's painfully nuanced characterization. It has been ten years since high school teacher Marchetta's break out hit, <i>Looking for Alibrandi</i>, came out in her native Australia, and the care and precision she took in getting Francesca's voice just right is evident. As a result, there isn't a girl alive that wouldn't feel right at home in Francesca's skin. Her frank observations about boys, with their hygienically-challenged habits and their ineptitude in dealing with the opposite sex, are dead-on and riotously funny. Marchetta deftly balances Francesca's humor with a sympathetic depiction of Mia's struggle with clinical depression, creating a well-rounded novel that will prompt both laughter and tears. Fans can only hope that they won't have to wait another decade for Marchetta to gift them with another of honest and moving story. <i>--Jennifer Hubert</i></p><i>MOST OF MY friends now go to Pius Senior College, but my mother wouldn't allow it because she says the girls there leave with limited options and she didn't bring me up to have limitations placed upon me. If you know my mother, you'll sense there's an irony there, based on the fact that she is the Queen of the Limitation Placers in my life.</i><br><br>Francesca battles her mother, Mia, constantly over what's best for her. All Francesca wants is her old friends and her old school, but instead Mia sends her to St. Sebastian's, an all-boys' school that has just opened its doors to girls. Now Francesca's surrounded by hundreds of boys, with only a few other girls for company. All of them weirdos--or worse.<br><br>Then one day, Mia is too depressed to get out of bed. One day turns into months, and as her family begins to fall apart, Francesca realizes that without her mother's high spirits, she hardly knows who she is. But she doesn't yet realize that she's more like Mia than she thinks. With a little unlikely help from St. Sebastian's, she just might be able to save her family, her friends, and--especially--herself.</p><h2>The Lakeside Master&#39;s Study of the Pulse</h2><p>Compiled in the late Ming dynasty, Li Shi-zhen&#39;s Lakeside Master&#39;s Study of the Pulse is still used and regarded as on of the best primers on this important diagnostic modality within Chinese medicine. Although this translation has not retained the meter and verse of the original, it is the most faithful English rendering of Li&#39;s actual words available today.

Ac. &amp; C.H., was born in 1946 and grew up in Rutherford, NJ. From the age of 14, Bob had three main areas of interest: writing/reading, philosophy, and biology. He attended Newark Academy and then Middlebury College where he earned a B.A. degree. His major in college was American Literature. In 1969, Bob went to India and Nepal to become a Buddhist yogi. He became the student of a family of Nyingmapa lamas headed by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche, the Ven. Jetsun Pema Rinpoche, and Sonam Kazi. When the Kazi family moved to New York City, Bob followed them at their request to continue his Buddhist training. Bob continued his Buddhist studies for 18 years, receiving oral transmissions, teachings, and empowerment from a number of Nyingmapa lamas, the last of which was Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche. He held various positions within the Nyingma hierarchy, including chopon (master of ceremonies), omdze (cantor), and lopon (teacher), and spent considerable time in solitary retreat. During this time, Bob also studied Tibetan medicine with such Lama doctors as Ven. Trogawa Rinpoche and Chagdud Tulku. <p>Because Bob could not see a clear path in the mid-1970s to becoming a Tibetan doctor, he decided to study its closest kin or cousin, Chinese medicine. President Nixon had reopened the United States' relationship with the People's Republic of China and James Reston had created a groundswell of interest in acupuncture with his articles about that subject in The New York Times. At that time, Bob knew of only one American acupuncture school, the New England School of Acupuncture. Before enrolling in their program, however, he decided to first study massage therapy in preparation for studying acupuncture. Therefore, in 1977, Bob moved to Boulder, CO to attend the Boulder School of Massage Therapy, which he graduated from in 1978. </p><p>At the same time, he began studying with another New York Nyingmapa who had moved to Colorado, Jerry Gardner. Jerry was a lifelong student and teacher of martial arts. In particular, Bob sought out Jerry's advice about ways of training the qi in his hands. So Bob started practicing various types of qi gong culled from a number of different styles of martial arts taught by Sifu Gardner. These included wing chun, tai ji quan, ba gua, and tai ji chi (tai ji ruler). Because of his previous many years of meditation and yogi practice, Bob quickly made progress in qi gong, and, after graduating from BSMT, opened the first qi gong school in the United States to operate outside of a martial arts context. This was the Blue Poppy Chi Kung Association. It was dedicated to teaching qi gong for health and healing purposes. In 1978, Bob invited Lucjan Shila, to teach for Blue Poppy. Lucjan was yet another New York Nyingmapa who had also studied and taught tai ji quan, xing yi, ba gua, and xi zang mi zong lama pai (Tibetan secret sect lama system, also known as Tibetan White Crane gong fu). Bob continued his qi gong studies with Lucjan, taking various qi gong exercises from the martial arts Lucjan taught. </p><p>In 1978, Bob became engaged to Honora Lee Wolfe, the founder and director of the Boulder School of Massage Therapy. This engagement effectively put an end to Bob's plans of attending the New England School of Acupuncture in Boston, MA. Therefore, he began studying acupuncture with Eric Tao (Xi-yu) in Denver, CO. Dr. Tao had learned the Tao family style of acupuncture from his uncle in Beijing when he was a teenager. After 1949, Dr. Tao and his family were forced to move to Taiwan due to their Guo Min Tang affiliation. There, Dr. Tao decided to make acupuncture his profession, and during the 1950, 60s, and early 70s became associated with Wu Wei-ping and his circle. Bob studied with Dr. Tao for a year and became certified by Dr. Tao in acupuncture-moxibustion. At the same time, Bob studied acupuncture and Chinese medicine whenever and wherever possible.

Originally written at the very end of the 16th century, it was almost immediately rendered into English and widely regarded. Containing a series of parables and metaphors regarding the process of creating the Philosopher&#39;s Stone, the Twelve Keys claim that alchemy is both real and potent, able to perfect matter and create a medicinal elixir beyond comprehension. Valentine swears that the process is not as others have described, with often vague references to &#34;special&#34; salt and sulfur, but is far easier and much less expensive than claimed in prior works.</p><p>Basil Valentine is the Anglicised version of the name Basilius Valentinus. Basilius Valentinus was alleged to be a 15th-century alchemist, possibly Canon of the Benedictine Priory of Saint Peter in Erfurt, Germany. During the 18th century it was suggested that the author of the works attributed to Basil Valentine was Johann Th�lde, a salt manufacturer in Germany who lived roughly 1565 &#x2013; 1624. Modern scholarship now suggests that one author was Th�lde, but that others were involved. Th�lde published the first five books under Valentine's name. Whoever he was, Basil Valentine had considerable chemical knowledge. He showed that ammonia could be obtained by the action of alkali on sal-ammoniac (ammonium chloride), described the production of hydrochloric acid by acidifying brine of common salt (sodium chloride), and created oil of vitriol (sulfuric acid), among other achievements.</p><h2>How to win souls and influence people for heaven</h2><p>This book comes from the heart of one dedicated to a definite task: winning souls and training others to be soul winners.

Musical instruments, from the simplest whistles to the most complex organs, conch trumpets to sousaphones, archers' and musical bows to violins and pianos, the most basic straw reeds to the modern MIDI systems, and pairs of stones struck together to synthesizers, are all described here by instrument collector and expert Jeremy Montagu. Montagu speculates on how these instruments originated in the earliest days of humanity and relates how they moved from one culture to another through history, all the while changing and developing until they became the instruments we know today. The book also surveys the present uses of instruments throughout the world.<br><br>Each chapter is devoted to a different type of instrument. Intervals and additional sections enhance the volume with information on musicians, the Medieval Renaissance, the ideal accompaniment, archaeology, symbiotic and newly created instruments, classification of instruments, scales and music, and some of the problems of acoustics. This comprehensive volume is illustrated with over 120 photos capturing several hundred instruments from all over the world; many of them from the author's own collection of over 2,500 instruments. A copious bibliography of sources, three indexes, and a series of maps make this a priceless resource.</p><p><b>Jeremy Montagu</b>, now retired, was the curator of the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments and lecturer in the Faculty of Music at University of Oxford. He has authored several books on musical instruments, including <i>Timpani &amp; Percussion</i> (2002), <i>Reed Instruments: An Annotated Catalogue</i> (Scarecrow Press, 2001), and <i>Musical Instruments of the Bible</i> (Scarecrow Press, 2002)....it is a concise, intelligent, contemporary equivalent, evincing the benefits of six decades of thought on the place of musical instruments in human life.

She has illustrated more than one hundred books for children. Her work has received the Caldecott Medal, Caldecott Honor awards, and the Boston Globe Horn Book Award. She lives in New Hampshire.Updike's 12 poems celebrate the changing seasons with images that might catch a child's eye. His verses, some of which are very lovely, focus on changes in the natural world (from snow to mud to crocuses) and on celebrations that accompany these changes (Christmas, Valentine's, Fourth of July). Each verse ends with a sound image that connects to the month's poem (such as the sound of fireworks or baseball heard on TV). Updike's presentation is earnest. While he sometimes overemphasizes line breaks in his poems, he has a kind voice and reads carefully, allowing time for children to enjoy the lovely gem-like illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman.

Behind every punctuation mark lies a thousand stories. The punctuation of English, marked with occasional rationality, is founded on arbitrariness and littered with oddities. For a system of a few dozen marks it generates a disproportionate degree of uncertainty and passion, inspiring organizations like the Apostrophe Protection Society and sending enthusiasts, correction-pens in hand, in a crusade against error across the United States. Professor Crystal leads us through this minefield with characteristic wit, clarity, and commonsense. In David Crystal's <i>Making a Point</i>, he gives a fascinating account of the origin and progress of every kind of punctuation mark over one and a half millennia and offers sound advice on how punctuation may be used to meet the needs of every occasion and context.</p><p>DAVID CRYSTAL<b> </b>is Honorary Professor of Linguistics at the University of Wales, Bangor.

Beginning with the academic-style painting of Thomas Eakins, through the abstraction of the American avant-garde (Marsden Hartley) during the onset of modernism, to the foucs on the muscular body in the mid-twentieth century (Hugo Gellert, Thomas Pollack Anshutz, Richmond Barthe) and into the homosexual civil rights movement of the late 1960s (Warhol, Mapplethorpe, Arthur Tress) and beyond (Keith Haring, Felix Gonzales-Torres, Bruce Weber), Weinberg&#39;s engaging text highlights particular artists while paying close attention to the artistic and cultural contexts in which they worked. Sexy, beautiful, edgy, and thought provoking, this important book is a must-have for every art-book collection as well as every gay person&#39;s coffee table.</p><p>Jonathan Weinberg, Ph.D., is a painter and art historian. He is a recipient of a 2002 Guggenheim Fellowship and is currently a fellow of the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts. His paintings are in many important collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Weinberg lives in Connecticut.Examining mediums from sculpture and painting to public health brochures, this lavishly illustrated survey looks for-and finds-a lot more homoeroticism in American art than one might expect. Weinberg's inquiry isn't merely prurient; he shows how American artists' depiction of male beauty has evolved with societal values toward gender roles. While earlier artists like George Bellows or Jared French had to frame appreciation of the male form within a larger context like sports, work, or a historical tableau, more contemporary artists like Robert Mapplethorpe openly celebrated gay identity and male nudity. Some of the most memorable images in the book include luminous black and white photographs by George Platt Lynes, wittily satiric paintings by Paul Cadmus and the sensuously beautiful paintings by Bay Area artist David Park. At times, the author attempts to find homoeroticism in places where it doesn't seem to be located, like in the conceptual work of Felix Gonzales-Torres. Nevertheless, this book is an enlightening look at homoerotic art, and a must have for anyone interested in the subject. 84 color illus, 112 b/w <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hardly a black or Hispanic face could be seen as the gray-suited, gray-haired businessmen--some leaning on walkers, others spry and ruddy-faced, with athletic builds honed on Harvard crew or tennis teams--and women in silk scarves and slimming black pants made their way through an unmarked door into Annenberg Hall. There was no campus announcement of the gathering, and no press coverage allowed.<br><br> Bouquets of forsythia and tulips decked out the usually spartan freshman dining hall. The visitors enjoyed cocktails, wine, and appetizers--beef tenderloin, crab cakes, asparagus spears--as well as the attentions of Lawrence Summers, then Harvard's president. Several guests chatted about the latest show by the Hasty Pudding Club, the student theatrical society that puts on a musical burlesque every spring featuring Harvard men in drag.<br><br> Then the Harvard band, perched in a balcony overhead, struck up "Ten Thousand Men of Harvard," and the group sat down to a candlelit dinner. Wine refills put the crowd in an expansive mood, and they frequently interrupted Summers's after-dinner speech with applause. The sole exception was when he outlined his initiative to boost enrollment of students from families earning less than $40,000 a year by making their Harvard educations free. He appeared to wait for an ovation that never came. I interpreted the awkward silence to convey a message, perhaps even a threat: If you make room for more low-income students by rejecting our children, we'll stop giving our millions.<br><br> The April 8 dinner kicked off the 2005 annual meeting of what is likely the wealthiest advisory group in higher education: Harvard's Committee on University Resources. Little known and rarely mentioned in the media, COUR is not actually a committee in the usual sense--it doesn't formally make or advise on university policy--but Summers or any other Harvard president needs its support. It consists of Harvard's biggest donors, who form the financial backbone of an endowment that totaled $25.5 billion as of fiscal 2005, making it the nation's largest, more than $10 billion ahead of second-place Yale's.<br><br> Committee membership has tripled in the past fifteen years, propelled by the university's record-setting $2.6 billion fund-raising campaign, which lasted from 1994 to 1999 and relied heavily on multimillion-dollar gifts. "As a member of COUR, you will be asked to play a leading role in the proposed campaign," committee chairman Robert G. Stone Jr. told members in 1991 in the first issue of its newsletter. By 2004, COUR's 424 members, handpicked by university fund-raisers, included ten of Forbes magazine's four hundred richest Americans, led by Microsoft chief executive Steven Ballmer (2005 net worth: $14 billion), oil tycoon Robert Bass ($3 billion), and banker David Rockefeller ($2.5 billion). Most are alumni of Harvard's undergraduate college or its graduate programs, but not all; Bass, for instance, went to archrival Yale, followed by business school at Stanford.<br><br> To qualify for membership, donors must generally have given at least $1 million to Harvard--or be expected to do so--although a few smaller donors were picked for their prowess in raising large sums from wealthy classmates and business associates on Harvard's behalf. The seventy-three members of the group's inner circle, the executive committee, have typically given or raised at least $5 million, and sometimes much more.<br><br> A free dinner and a newsletter aren't the only signs of Harvard's gratitude to COUR members. The school summons top faculty to the committee's annual meeting to expound on such topics as nanotechnology and the science of aging. It names athletic facilities, research centers, faculty chairs, fellowships, and scholarships after donors.<br><br> And, in the most valuable reward of all, Harvard gives a massive admissions edge to their children, who flourish in a selection process that lacks conflict-of-interest rules and systematically favors the wealthy and well-connected. Although Harvard bridles at any suggestion that its slots are for sale, I found numerous instances in which a child's acceptance closely preceded or followed a major gift from the parents, giving at least the appearance of a quid pro quo. Most notably, a politically connected New Jersey real estate mogul with no Harvard ties pledged $2.5 million to the university only months before his elder son--a student below Harvard's usual standards--was admitted.<br><br> Harvard admits fewer than one in ten undergraduate applicants, turning down more than half of candidates with perfect SAT scores. Nine-tenths of its freshman ranked in the top 10 percent of their high school classes. Its graduate and professional schools boast similarly high standards: Harvard law school, for instance, accepts only 11 percent of applicants.<br><br> Children of major donors enjoy far better odds. By examining Who's Who entries, alumni records, and other sources, I found that 218 of 424 COUR members, or more than half, have had at least one child at Harvard. Many donors send more than one child to Harvard, bringing the total number of COUR members' offspring who have enrolled there over the years to at least 336. Nearly three hundred of these children attended Harvard as undergraduates, with most of the rest attending the law and business schools, which provide an entree into the corridors of American power.<br><br> Since, by my count, at least eighty COUR members either do not have children or their children have not reached college age, the number of COUR offspring who have gone to Harvard works out to 336 children of about 340 eligible members--an astonishing enrollment rate of one child per major donor. Given that the typical married couple in the United States has one or two children, that wealthy women tend to have fewer children than the average, and that many children of COUR members never apply to Harvard at all, a conservative conclusion would be that the university welcomes well over half of applicants from the families of its biggest donors.<br><br> Through their easy access to Harvard, the children of COUR members don't just gain intellectual polish. They also acquire a prestigious career credential and high-powered friends and spouses, consolidating their families' place in the American aristocracy. "Last year we completed a double 'hat trick' when my youngest daughter, Morgan, married Harvard classmate John Stafford," investment banker Ralph Hellmold, a member of the Committee on University Resources, boasted to his Harvard classmates on their fortieth reunion in 2002. "Thus, each of my three daughters has not only graduated from the college, but married her own Harvard man."<br><br> Executive committee member James O. Welch Jr., former vice chairman of RJR Nabisco Inc. and a Harvard alumnus who endowed a professorship in computer science, leads the way in the admissions sweepstakes, with six sons who graduated from Harvard. Welch declined comment. Similarly, Finn M. W. Caspersen's generosity has not gone unrewarded in admissions to Harvard Law, a school whose preference for children of well-heeled alumni was satirized in Legally Blonde. The heroine of the hit 2001 comedy, played by Reese Witherspoon, learns from a classmate that her dim-witted ex-boyfriend, Warner Huntington III, "got wait-listed when he applied. His father had to make a call."<br><br> Caspersen, a Harvard Law alumnus who also sits on the COUR executive committee, formerly headed consumer lending giant Beneficial Corp., which specializes in making high-interest loans to consumers with poor credit. He and his wife have endowed several faculty chairs at the law school and donated to its library, where the rare-book room is named after them. Caspersen, who now runs a private investment firm, chairs a $400 million fund-raising campaign that the law school launched in 2003. Four Caspersen children--Finn junior (who also has a Harvard bachelor's degree), Erik, Samuel, and Andrew--have enrolled at Harvard Law. The Caspersens declined comment.<br><br> Professor David R. Herwitz, who served for years on the law school's admissions committee, told me that Caspersen's sons were fine students and "totally admissible." He added, "Any school, particularly one with a long tradition, becomes something of a family. What kind of a crazy world would it be if people who had gone to the school and made contributions would be told: your kid is very close, but not close enough?"<br> Undoubtedly some children of COUR members were superb candidates whom Harvard might have admitted even if they were unhooked. For others, the preferences of privilege outweighed test scores or grades below Harvard norms. These fortunate candidates with marginal credentials--like many minorities aided by affirmative action--are often saddled with self-doubt, wondering if they deserved their Harvard admission.<br><br> Most COUR children at Harvard have been legacies--a group to which Harvard acknowledges giving at least a small admissions boost. Harvard accepts one third of alumni children, nearly four times its overall admission rate. Legacies constitute 13 percent of the student body. William Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid at Harvard, who has been a guest speaker at COUR meetings, told me that he personally reads all applications from alumni children. He said the average SAT score of legacies admitted to Harvard falls just a couple of points below the school's overall average, and that he uses legacy status as a tie-breaker between comparable ...</p><h2>My Loose Thread</h2><p>At the heart of Dennis Cooper's novel lies Larry, a teenager wrestling not only with his sexuality and the implications of a physical relationship with his younger brother, but with the very point of his existence.

Bernhardson also offers various trip strategies, including The Andean Lakes Loop and The Natural History Tour. Including details on exploring the penguin-dotted Falkland Islands, staying in guest ranches in the Patagonian outback, and whale watching at the World Heritage Site of Pen�nsula Vald�s, <i>Moon Patagonia</i> gives travelers the tools they need to create a more personal and memorable experience.<br></p><p>Wayne Bernhardson first traveled to Patagonia in 1979, visiting both Chile and Argentina as far as Tierra del Fuego, "the uttermost part of the earth," and has returned to the region almost every year since 1990. He also spent a year walking, sailing, and flying around the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) and had the pleasure of revisiting them to research this book. He owns an apartment in Buenos Aires, near the Palermo botanical gardens, and spends four to five months in the "Southern Cone" countries every year.<br><br>Wayne earned his PhD in geography at the University of California, Berkeley, but abandoned academia for a perpetual Latin American road trip that many university faculty envy.

Some combination of a translation, an adaptation, and a new poem inspired from an old wellspring, <i>War Music</i> is violent, beautiful, hypnotic, and terrifying. This is Homer for the era of Stephen King and Quentin Tarentino.In his brilliant rendering of eight books of Homer's <i>Iliad</i>, Logue here retells some of the most evocative episodes of the war classic, including the death of Patroclus and Achilles's fateful return to battle, that sealed the doom of Troy. Compulsively readable, Logue's poetry flies off the page, and his compelling descriptions of the horrors of war have a surreal, dreamlike quality that has been compared to the films of Kurosawa. Retaining the great poem's story line but rewriting every incident, Logue brings the Trojan War to life for modern audiences.</p><h2>McCain&#39;s Promise: Aboard the Straight Talk Express with John McCain and a Whole Bunch of Actual Reporters, Thinking About Hope</h2><p><b>Is John McCain "For Real?"</b><br><br>That's the question David Foster Wallace set out to explore when he first climbed aboard Senator McCain's campaign caravan in February 2000. It was a moment when Mccain was increasingly perceived as a harbinger of change, the anticandidate whose goal was "to inspire young Americans to devote themselves to causes greater than their own self-interest." And many young Americans were beginning to take notice.<br><br>To get at "something riveting and unspinnable and true" about John Mccain, Wallace finds he must pierce the smoke screen of spin doctors and media manipulators. And he succeeds-in a characteristically potent blast of journalistic brio that not only captures the lunatic rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign but also delivers a compelling inquiry into John McCain himself: the senator, the POW, the campaign finance reformer, the candidate, the man.</p><p>David Foster Wallace was born in Ithaca, New York, in 1962 and raised in Illinois, where he was a regionally ranked junior tennis player. He received bachelor of arts degrees in philosophy and English from Amherst College and wrote what would become his first novel, <em>The Broom of the System</em>, as his senior English thesis. He received a masters of fine arts from University of Arizona in 1987 and briefly pursued graduate work in philosophy at Harvard University. His second novel,<em> Infinite Jest</em>, was published in 1996. Wallace taught creative writing at Emerson College, Illinois State University, and Pomona College, and published the story collections <em>Girl with Curious Hair</em>, <em>Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</em>, <em>Oblivion, </em>the essay collections <em>A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,</em> and <em>Consider the Lobster</em>.

Larsson's novels have sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide.<br>ABOUT THE TRANSLATOR:<br> <b>Laurie Thompson</b> is the distinguished translator of novels by Henning Mankell and Hakan Nesser. He was editor of <i>Swedish Book Review</i> until 2002."Spanning a century, the plot is labyrinthine and suspenseful. Larsson's characters and their worlds are closely observed, revealing small-town small-mindedness in contemporary Sweden and the elemental struggle for survival a century before, when children might be sold into servitude at a "pauper's auction." Larsson has given her fans another winner."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Booklist </b>on<b> </b></i><i>Until Thy Wrath Be Past</i></i></b><br><br>"Compelling . . . Larsson excels at creating engaging, complex characters whose interactions and development provide as much forward momentum as the search for the killer."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i></i></b><br><br>"With a more literary approach to the genre... Larsson remains one of the brightest stars in the current Nordic firmament... perceptive touches quicken the narrative throughout, and the characterization of the bloody-minded Rebecka (who Larsson really puts through the mill here) keeps <i>The Second Deadly Sin</i> firmly grounded."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Barry Forshaw, <i>The Independent</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A must read series for me and the novel's ending hints at new directions for Rebecka which should shake up future books a little."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Louise Welsh, <i>Crimepieces</i></b></i></b><br><br>"shows that Larsson is yet another powerful Nordic storyteller"&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Minneapolis Star Tribune</b></i></i></b><br><br>"�sa Larsson's books have a strong feeling of female empowerment, and not just through the strong female leads of Rebecka and Anna-Marie. This book manages to cleverly pass comment on how arrogance, pompousness and at times, weakness in a subset of men can lead to undesirable outcomes (though I should say that most men in the story are depicted in a much more favourable light!). It also shows how strong ties and co-operation between women are important in finding solutions. Rebecka's vulnerability and sense of past, combined with her strong-mindedness determination, thoughtfulness, and ever-developing character is something the reader can empathise and engage with. An interesting plot, combined with intriguing characters, means that all I want now is to read the next outing in the series!

Dr. Lewis presents a groundbreaking alternative approach to infertility, explaining how she used traditional Chinese medicine to treat her own infertility, successfully conceiving and giving birth to two children.</p><p>Randine Lewis, Ph.D., master of science in Oriental Medicine, is a licensed acupuncturist and herbalist who has studied both Eastern and Western medicine. She has a practice in Houston and is opening one in Asheville, North Carolina.Lewis, a licensed acupuncturist and herbalist, believes infertile couples should turn to Chinese medicine as an alternative to what she considers painful, invasive and time-consuming Western treatments. She first explains, "Traditional Chinese medicine holds that a woman's body must be gently nourished and encouraged to bear fruit.... I have found that most hormonal imbalances (which contribute to 40 percent of documented cases of infertility, yet are considered untreatable by conventional Western medicine) respond to Eastern methods of treatment." In Lewis's experience, women who have undergone three to six months of the dietary changes, herbs and acupuncture treatments become pregnant with no further effort. Lewis intersperses her somewhat technical examination of the program with anecdotes about her patients, weaving in discussions on diet, herbal supplements, acupuncture, older women and problems related to infertility. Lewis writes well and simplifies many complex concepts, such as the theory that there are four vital substances in the body (Yin, Yang, Qi and Blood), and that they're likely to be suffering from imbalance caused by energy excess, deficiency or stagnation. However, she trusts that her view is the solution for all infertile couples. Readers with infertility issues may well benefit by adopting some of Lewis's strategies, but they would also be wise to discuss her approach with their doctors before abandoning their current treatments. 41 line drawings. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although it wasn't her nature to fret, she noticed her hands were shaking and she was perspiring heavily. Her underarms and the small of her back were damp, and her eyes burned with lack of sleep. It's time to buck up, she silently told herself, annoyed by this betrayal of her inner turmoil. She wasn't going to let her troubles undermine her self-confidence or her sense of fun.<br><br>She refused to let Thomas Blackburn get to her. He and his four-year-old granddaughter had come down for the weekend from Paris, a typical presumptuousness on Thomas's part. Annette hadn't invited him. A Bostonian like herself, he had known her all her life. She had grown up around the corner from his house on Beacon Hill. But as much as she looked up to him, as much as she'd wanted him to admire her, she couldn't consider him a friend. He was too old, almost twenty years her senior, and perhaps knew her too well. With Thomas, pretenses were impossible.<br><br>He was at the breakfast table overlooking the rose garden, with a mug of black coffee at his elbow and the Paris <em>Le Monde </em>opened up in front of him so that Annette couldn't miss the latest blaring headline about the jewel thief who'd plagued the C�te d'Azur for the past eight weeks. He'd been dubbed <em>Le Chat </em>after the Cary Grant character in the popular American movie <em>To Catch a Thief. </em>Once again, the police promised the imminent arrest of a suspect.<br><br>This time they weren't just blowing smoke. Annette knew better.<br><br>Thomas hadn't said a word beyond a simple good-morning. He had come to the Riviera just to visit her, he'd told Annette with his wry smile, knowing she wouldn't believe him. As always, he had a loftier purpose in mind: to convince her Vietnamese caretaker, a mandarin scholar respected both abroad and in his own country, to return home. Thomas would go on and on about how Saigon needed credible centrist leaders and how Quang Tai could help save his country from disaster, and Annette would pretend a suitable neutrality, despite the prospect of losing her caretaker. She was only sparing herself one of Thomas's notorious lectures on not being shortsighted and selfish; she suspected he already knew she didn't want the bother of having to replace Quang Tai.<br><br>She sighed, frantically mincing one half of the onion. Her eyes had begun to tear, and if she didn't slow down and be careful, she'd likely chop off the end of a finger. Thomas wouldn't keep quiet for long. It wasn't a Blackburn trait.<br><br>The newspaper rustled as he turned a page, and she heard him take a small sip of coffee.<br><br>"All right, Thomas, you win," she said, whirling around with her paring knife. "What do you want to tell me that you're trying so hard <em>not </em>to tell me? You might as well spit it out, because you know you'll get around to it sooner or later."<br><br>Looking slightly miffed at her sharp-sighted observation, Thomas folded the newspaper and laid it on the table. Like all Blackburns, he was a man of impeccable moral and intellectual respectability&#x2014;the kind of highbrow Boston-ian that Annette usually found boring and irritating. For two centuries, the Blackburns had been outspoken patriots, historians, poets, reformers, public servants and eccentrics, if not the best moneymakers. Eliza Blackburn&#x2014;the patron saint of the family&#x2014;was one of Boston's favorite Revolutionary War heroines. Her portrait, painted by Gilbert Stuart, hung in the Massachusetts State House; in it she wore the cameo brooch that George Washington himself had presented to her, in gratitude for her efforts at smuggling weapons, ammunition and information from British-occupied Boston to the patriot forces in outlying areas. The Winstons, on the other hand, had snuck off to Halifax for the duration of the War of Independence. Eliza had also been virtually the only mercantile-minded Blackburn in two hundred years. She'd been the driving force behind Blackburn Shipping, which made a fortune in the post-Revolution China trade, but folded in 1812 with the British blockade and the war. That was that for a Blackburn generating any substantial income. Eliza's descendants had been stretching her fortune ever since, and it was beginning to fray.<br><br>Annette had heard rumblings that Thomas, Harvard-educated and approaching fifty, was about to launch his own business. He was an authority on the history and culture of Indochina and spent much of his time there, but how he planned to translate that expertise into a moneymaking enterprise was beyond her.<br><br>He regarded her with a calm that only accentuated her own nervousness. "Annette, I'd like to ask you a straightforward question&#x2014;do you know this thief <em>Le Chat?"</em><br><br>"Don't be ridiculous. How would I know him?"<br><br>Her mouth went dry, her heartbeat quickened and she felt curiously light-headed. She'd never fainted in all her thirty years; now wasn't the time to start. Trying to hide her trembling hands, she set down the paring knife and leaned against the counter. She was dressed casually in baggy men's khaki trousers and an oversize white cotton shirt, her ash-brown hair pulled up in a hasty knot. If she worked at it, she could look rather stunning at first glance, but she had no illusions that she was an especially beautiful woman. She was too pale-skinned, too large-framed, too pear-shaped, too tall. Her near-black eyebrows were mannishly heavy and might have overwhelmed a more delicate face, but she had a strong nose, Katharine Hepburn cheeks and big eyes that were a ringing, memorable blue&#x2014; her best feature by far. She'd hated her long legs as a teenager, but over the years she had discovered they had their advantages in bed. Even her husband, not the most passionate of men, would cry out in pleasure when she'd wrap them around him and pull him deeper into her.<br><br>"Annette," Thomas said.<br><br>It was the same tone he'd used on her when he'd caught her crossing Beacon Street alone at six years old. Nineteen years her senior, he was already a widower then, with a two-year-old son. Emily Blackburn, so quietly beautiful and intelligent, had died of postpartum complications, the first person Annette had ever known to die. She had only wanted to ride the swan boats in the Public Garden and had explained this to Thomas, assuring him her mother had said it was all right. He had said, "Annette," just that way&#x2014; admonishing, knowing, expecting more of her than a transparent lie. Feeling as if she'd failed him, she'd blurted out the truth. Her mother hadn't said it was all right; she thought Annette was playing alone in the garden. Thomas had marched her home at once.<br><br>She was no longer six years old.<br><br>"I promised the children I'd take them out to pick flowers," she said, pulling herself up straight. "They're waiting."<br><br>She was at the kitchen door when Thomas spoke again. "Annette, this man's no Cary Grant. He's a thief who has lined his own pockets with other people's things and driven a decent woman to suicide."<br><br>Annette spun around and gave him a haughty look. "I quite agree."<br><br>Shaking his head, Thomas rose to his feet. He was a tall, lean man with sharp features and straight, fine hair that was a mixture of dark brown, henna highlights and touches of gray. The scrimpiest of the notoriously frugal Blackburns, he wore a shabby sweater that had probably seen him through his postgraduate studies at Harvard and trousers he'd let out, unabashedly leaving the old seam to show.<br><br>"I would never presume to judge you," he told her softly. "I hope you know that."<br><br>Annette held back an incredulous laugh. "Thomas, you're a Blackburn. It's your nature to judge everyone and everything."<br><br>He grimaced, but there was a gleam in his intensely blue eyes. "You're saying I'm a critical old fart."<br><br>She smiled for the first time in hours. "Not that old. Let's just say people always know where they stand with you&#x2014;and you're a better man than most. Make yourself at home. I'll be back in an hour or so."<br><br>To her surprise and relief, Thomas let her go without another word.<br><br>Taking a gaggle of children flower-picking wasn't something Annette relished, even on a good day, but they quickly busied themselves plucking every blossom in sight. Surrendering to their enthusiasm, she abandoned her halfhearted effort to separate weed from wildflower and plopped down in the straw grass. It was warm in the sun under the incomparable blue of the Mediterranean sky, and the scent of wild-flowers, lemons and sea permeated the air, soothing her restlessness and feeling of inundation. Down through the small field and olive grove, she could see the red-tiled roof and simple lines of her stone <em>mas, </em>the eighteenth-century farmhouse where she'd spent a part of every year since she was a girl. It was as much home to her as Boston was. In many ways, more so, for it was here on the Riviera she could be alone, with just her son and his nanny&#x2014;without Benjamin, without the pressures of being a Boston Winston and a well-bred woman whose idea of fulfillment was supposed to be making everyone's life interesting but her own.<br><br>The children's zeal for flower-picking waned faster than she'd hoped, but her nephew Jared, the eldest at nine, launched a game of tag. Quentin was reluctant and terrified, his mother suspected, the girls would beat him. He was seven, a sturdy, towheaded boy with a quiet manner and a head full of dreams and ideas whose execution defeated him. A game of tag was precisely the kind of open, raw confrontation he tried to avoid. He was his father's son, Annette thought, with a lack of affection she was becoming used to. Even Quentin, however, couldn't prevail against his cousin's strong will.<br><br>The game got off to an aggressive start, and Annette nudged the flower basket closer to her. She didn't want the children in their exuberance to knock it over. The flowers wouldn't suffer; they were mostly rot. But she'd hate to have to explain why she'd tucked a .25-caliber automatic under the calico cloth lining the bottom of her flower basket.<br><br><em>"Bon matin, ma belle."</em><br><br>She hadn't heard his approach. She twisted around, but he was concealed behind the knotted trunk of an olive tree, out of the children's view. Their game was already getting out of hand. Quang Tai's six-year-old daughter, Tam, a mite of a girl, was beating the socks off the two boys and loving every minute of it, teasing them in her mixture of English, French and Vietnamese. Jared boasted he'd get her next game, but Quentin, ever the sore loser, accused her of cheating. Tam was having none of it. Jared remained neutral in the ensuing squabble, but then they both turned on him. Four-year-old Rebecca Blackburn amused herself by throwing grass on the three older children, becoming more and more daring until they finally paid attention to her.<br><br>"You can't catch me," she cried jubilantly as the two boys and Tam chased her.<br><br>Blue-eyed, chestnut-haired Blackburn though little Rebecca was, Annette had to admire the girl's spunk. In another thirty years, she'd probably be as sanctimonious as her grandfather.<br><br>Mercifully, Tam's father called from the edge of the field, and all four little monsters scrambled toward him. Annette promised she'd be along in a while and pulled her flower basket onto her lap. The gun had added weight to it.<br><br>"You can come out now, Jean-Paul," she said.<br><br>He ambled out from behind the tree and squatted down, dropping a daisy into her basket. Annette tried to check the rush of raw desire she felt every time she saw him. It didn't work. From their first encounter weeks ago, she had been obsessed with Jean-Paul Gerard. She could never get enough of him; he could never satisfy her, sexually or emotionally. Whenever they made love she wanted more of him. Even after multiple couplings in one night, she'd awaken aching for him. He could tell her a thousand times he loved her, and she would long to hear it again&#x2014;and yet never believed him. Jean-Paul was twenty-four years old and one of the most popular men in France. She was a thirty-year-old married woman with stretch marks on her breasts and abdomen.<br><br>She hated to give him up.<br><br>She noticed the sun-whitened hairs on his tanned arms. He was so handsome, so arrogantly French. Leanly built, he was a dark, sleek, wiry man, his eyes a deep brown, soft and oddly vulnerable&#x2014;and keen. They had to be. He was one of France's premiere Grand Prix drivers, a risk-taking, desirable man who radiated a generous and unquenchable sexuality. He could have had virtually any woman he wanted. He had chosen Annette. She had never had any illusions that their affair would last, but she supposed she ought to derive some satisfaction at being the one to end it. He curled a loose tendril of hair behind her ear and brushed two fingers along the line of her jaw. "I missed you last night."<br><br>"Jean-Paul..." For nothing at all she'd strip herself naked and make love to him right there in the grass under the olive tree. The children and her caretaker and Thomas Blackburn and her entire future be damned. She licked her lips, parched to the point of cracking, and squinted at her lover, sitting in the shade with the bright morning sun at his back. "Have you seen the papers?"<br><br>Nodding, he sighed and sat back in the grass.<br><br>"That's why I called you." Her voice quavered; she didn't like that. She cleared her throat and forced herself not to look away. "Last night I became <em>Le Chat's </em>latest victim. I was at the roulette wheel, wearing a Tiffany diamond-and-pearl bracelet&#x2014;"<br><br>He looked pained. <em>"Ma belle..."</em><br><br>"No, don't. Let me finish. The bracelet was a gift to me from my husband on our fifth anniversary. There's an inscription. The police..." Her throat was so dry and tight she felt she would choke. "I gave the police an exact description."<br><br>Jean-Paul accepted her words without apparent surprise or concern. "What else did you tell the police?"<br><br>Annette hesitated, then said, "Enough."<br><br>He looked away from her, his soft eyes lost in the shade.<br><br>"They've gone to your house, Jean-Paul. I would expect they're there now and have already found my bracelet&#x2014;"<br><br>"You used the key I gave you?"<br><br>"Yes. Last night, while you were asleep."<br><br>He turned back to her, assessing her with the same alertness and intensity that had made him one of the finest race-car drivers in the world. This time, his craving for excitement and danger had led him astray.<br><br></p><h2>How to Knit (Art Ideas) (Art Ideas)</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p>&#39;How I wish this book had been available when I learnt to knit&#39; - School Librarian Journal; &#39;A great companion for the novice knitter.

This narrative has motivated more than a decade of wars, and re-prioritized America&#x2019;s domestic security and law enforcement agenda. But the conventional narrative is wrong.<br><br>A different group of jihadists exists within U.S. borders. This group has a long but hidden history, is outside the purview of public officials and has an agenda as apocalyptic as anything Al Qaeda has to offer. Radical sects of Christianity have inspired some of the most grotesque acts of violence in American history: the 1963 Birmingham Church bombing that killed four young girls; the Mississippi Burning&#x201d; murders of three civil rights workers in 1964; the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968, the Atlanta Child Murders in the late 1970s; and the Oklahoma City Bombing in 1995. <i>America's Secret Jihad</i> uses these crimes to tell a story that has not been told before.<br><br>Expanding upon the author&#x2019;s groundbreaking work on the Martin Luther King, Jr. murder, and through the use of extensive documentation, never-before-released interviews, and a re-interpretation of major events, <i>America's Secret Jihad</i> paints a picture of Christian extremism and domestic terrorism as it has never before been portrayed.</p><p><b>Stuart Wexler</b> was born and raised in New Jersey.

Hancock and Wexler investigate why commanders-in-chief find secrecy appealing. The U.S. sponsorship of the operations detailed in this tome was concealed in most cases to avoid political controversy within the U.S. or within a country hosting the covert program. The authors cite FDR&#x2019;s authorization to create an American air force in China the Flying Tigers as a template; the president decided the action was necessary but impolitic to reveal to the public. So it went with secret Cold War military operations in Tibet, Indochina, Guatemala, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Afghanistan. So it continues in the conflict with radical Islam. Deniability as a feature of covert warfare parallels the authors&#x2019; attention to tactical methods, such as the use of front companies, which may interest readers of intelligence history, while those concerned with the constitutionality of this subject will be sated with discussion of its legal aspects. Because their extensive research is wrapped in politically neutral prose, Hancock and Wexler can engage a range of readers with a controversial topic." --Gilbert Taylor, <i>Booklist</i></p><h2>Rose Wylie</h2><p>Rose Wylie (born 1934) trained as an artist in the 1950s, but it was her re-engagement with painting in the early 1980s, after a period spent raising a family, that marked the beginning of a remarkable career that continues to evolve and impress. This monograph, the first of its kind, follows Wylie's fascinating artistic journey&#x2014;celebrating her achievements while also examining her current practice. Rose Wylie's large-scale paintings are inspired by a wide range of visual culture. Her subject matter ranges from contemporary Egyptian Hajj wall paintings and Persian miniatures to films, news stories, celebrity gossip, and her observation of daily life. Often working from memory, she distills her subjects into succinct observations, using text to give additional emphasis to her recollections. In weaving together imagery from different sources with personal elements, Wylie's paintings offer a direct and wry commentary on contemporary culture. Her pictures refuse judgment but reveal a concern with the everyday that makes visible its enigmatic core. Drawing on a series of extended interviews with the artist, Clarrie Wallis unpacks the complexities of Wylie's visual language, providing an important contribution to our understanding&nbsp;and appreciation of&nbsp;a significant&nbsp;and increasingly celebrated&nbsp;figure in contemporary British art.</p><p><b>Clarrie Wallis</b> is Senior Curator of Contemporary British Art at Tate and has organized numerous exhibitions including <i>Richard Long: Heaven and Earth</i> (2013),<i> Patrick Caulfield</i> (2013), <i>BP Spotlight: Rose Wylie</i> (2013), and <i>Mona Hatoum</i> (2016).

With 16 pages of glossy b&amp;w photographs. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Test pilots have varied jobs: production, testing for faults in manufacture; engineering, to get data on the performance of airframe and engine; and experimental, to see if the plane flies and how far to take its performance. Of the latter it has been said, "hours of boredom interspersed by moments of sheer terror." Guyton was the test pilot (all three types) for the Vought Corsair. Entertainingly he relates how that plane became the success it was. There is technical data galore, but this is readably done. World War II was fought on American soil, too, by the author and his well-described comrades (including Charles Lindbergh), who tamed the raw power of the innovative F4U and made it ready to fight in the Pacific.

To live life most fully, he insists, we must take risks, and he warns those looking for instant gratification that being in God's will is inherently risky, as it does not ensure protection from harm or difficulty. McManus, who is also a pastor, challenges the readers to act on what they already know about God from Scripture and prayer rather than wait for a heavenly sign before moving forward. "There are certain things that you do not need a calling to do," he gently chides. "You've already been commanded to do them. Too many divine opportunities are lost because we keep waiting for a word when the word has already been given." A good mix of anecdotes, personal experiences, Biblical study and commentary, this book will be inspirational for those seeking to lead a more deliberate, spiritual life. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Days of Hope: 70&#39;S Gay San Francisco</h2><p>Catch a glimpse of liberated San Francisco, the world&#39;s first fully conscious gay and lesbian community, through Barton&#39;s vivid photos, taken before the AIDS devastation which took the lives of both he and his lover.[gay men][photography][erotic]</p><p></p><h2>The New Kayak Shop: More Elegant Wooden Kayaks Anyone Can Build</h2><p>From coast to coast, home boatbuilders have turned to Chris Kulczycki for everything they needed to know about making their own kayaks from high-grade marine plywood and epoxy.

His own account of day-to-day life in one of London's best loved and most stylish bookshops had been used to flesh out Hill's glittering correspondence with Nancy Mitford who referred to him as 'the spy in the bookshop'. So here is the real thing. A lively, alarming and candid account of life behind the counter in a fashionable west end bookshop, where all was most definitely not what it seemed, and where deep passions and often irrational animosities flourished and occasionally broke the surface, to the alarm of customers, staff and owners alike. Witty, stylish and full of insights into literature, the book trade and miscellaneous human weaknesses, this correspondence between the new blood and the retired former owner provide further entertainment, and wisdom, about the surprisingly turbulent world of literary bookselling in the very recent past.</p><p>John Saumarez Smith has worked at Heywood Hill&#39;s bookshop since 1965 and managed it since 1974. He reviews, catalogues and lectures on books, advises on private and other libraries, acts as Honorary Librarian at Chequers, and has been variously described as a book man, a book expert and a book doctor.</p><h2>The Intuitive Healer: Accessing Your Inner Physician</h2><p>A guide to recognizing the emotional and physical imbalances that often cause disease explains how to use such techniques as word association, meditation, body scanning, and mind mapping to diagnose and treat illness</p><p>Do we really know what's good for us? "Yes!" the author of this book would yell, and in about as profound and important a way as could possibly be imagined. This is one of a series of books and programs that Marcia Emery has written on the subject of intuitive healing. Her basic premise is that each of us has an inner guide--an "inner physician"--whom we need to learn to access and listen to. Why? Because, says Emery, this inner guide (essentially, our own intuitive mind) can help us maintain health, predict and avert health problems, suggest remedies in times of illness, and steer us towards a healthier way of functioning that will offer long-term prevention. <p> Emery describes intuition as "that unerring and inexplicable knowing beyond logic and volition. It lies at the roots of spontaneity, humor, creativity, inspiration, and even genius. And it is an especially powerful ally in the healing process." It is how scientists make groundbreaking discoveries, and how native peoples discover healing plants in the wild. </p><p> Emery's book is a practical how-to manual that each of us can deploy "to access the wisdom of your mind for greater healing and well-being." She offers tips, techniques, and exercises, such as meditation, affirmations, dreamwork, relaxation, body scans, and word association, together with heartening anecdotes and case studies. The benefits claimed for this approach--from testing medical diagnoses to averting illness--are profound indeed, and this book makes for a user-friendly, thought-provoking guide. <i>--Dan Fielder</i></p>Praise for <i>The Intuitive Healer</i>:<p> "A very helpful resource for those who are ready and willing to take the lid off and communicate with their inner wisdom." --Bernie Siegel, M.D., author of <i>Love, Medicine, and Miracles</i> and <i>Prescriptions for Living</i></p><p> "A generous, practical, and accessible mix of exercises and suggestions from a broad and eclectic range of sources to access the inner healer and complement more traditional medical approaches." --Belleruth Naparstek, author of <i>Your Sixth Sense: Unlocking the Power of Your Intuition</i></p><p> "Filled with heart and soul, wisdom and inspiration...<i>The Intuitive Healer</i> contains practical recipes for health and step-by-step instructions for accessing a powerful inner resource...I recommend it highly." --Jeffrey Mishlove, PH.D., president of Intuition Network, host of <i>Thinking Allowed</i>, and author of <i>The Roots of Consciousness</i></p><p> "<i>The Intuitive Healer</i> provides not only the tools to assist you with that inner knowledge but much more--the key to dealing with stress, the basic cause of all illness." --C.

He is the author of many books, including Introducing Eastern Orthodox Theology (SPCK, 2013)."Contemporary Orthodox theology is like a spring flower that has budded after a harsh winter's thaw. This book signals the blossoming of Orthodox theology in the English-speaking world after centuries of inhospitable historical conditions under Islam and Communism. Previously confined to traditional Orthodox countries such as Russia, Romania, Greece and Serbia, Orthodox theology today is emerging with striking advances in Western Europe and North America. With vast erudition, this stunningly well-conceived book traces the influence of the spiritual classic, the <em>Philokalia</em>, on leading Orthodox thinkers, lay theologians and monastics in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This original work provides an unparalleled resource for understanding the theological vision of Orthodox thinkers over the last two centuries. It is a landmark achievement that validates the thesis that the Orthodox Church is on the cusp of a major theological renaissance in the twenty-first century." (Bradley Nassif, professor of biblical and theological studies, North Park University, coeditor of The Philokalia: A Classic Text of Orthodox Spirituality)<br><br>"Through the lives and thought of a score of Orthodox theologians, Andrew Louth shows the distinctiveness of their theology, grounded not in academic concepts and constructs but rather in prayer, paths toward holiness and the experience of the living church. A thoroughly engaging introduction to the ways of modern Orthodox theology." (Vigen Guroian, author of The Melody of Faith)<br><br>"Fr. Andrew Louth, who is himself one of the foremost Orthodox theologians of our time, offers us in this volume much more than a survey of 'modern Orthodox thinkers,' despite the humble simplicity of the title. The wonderfully surprising grace of this work is that it succeeds in communicating not only the thought of the major figures in modern Orthodox theology but the spiritual wellsprings of that thought in Orthodox prayer and liturgy. An equally inspired feat is his presentation of the rich diversity of modern Orthodoxy, comprising clerical and lay theologians, both men and women, hailing from a great variety of backgrounds and perspectives. This is a work of scholarship that is imbued with a Eucharistic spirit. The reader will feel both nourished by its erudition and deeply grateful for its illumination of the manifold manifestations of the Spirit in modern Orthodoxy." (Khaled Anatolios, University of Notre Dame)<br><br>"This is a most thorough, very accessible, and fascinating overview of modern Orthodox theology, with very helpful presentation as well as commentary by the author. It will become the standard text in courses on the Eastern Church and its thought for years to come." (Michael Plekon, Cistercian Studies Quarterly, 51.3, 2016)<br><br>"Rewarding and timely, <em>Modern Orthodox Thinkers</em> is both an informative introduction to a gallery of individual thinkers and a coherent meditation on the significance of Orthodox thought in the modern world." (Avril Pyman, FBA, reader emerita in Russian literature, University of Durham)<br><br>"By following the trajectory of Orthodox thought wherever it has blossomed across the world, this revelatory book charts a whole new constellation in the cosmos of Eastern Christianity. Andrew Louth's warm and lucid exposition, combined with his deep learning, makes him the ideal ambassador of the religious ideals he explores." (Rosamund Bartlett, author of Tolstoy: A Russian Life)<br><br>"We have needed this book for a long time. Praise to Andrew Louth for his extraordinary breadth and depth in painting a multicolored portrait of the many faces of Orthodox theology since the late eighteenth century." (Sarah Hinlicky Wilson, Institute for Ecumenical Research, Strasbourg, consultant, International Lutheran-Orthodox Joint Commission)<br><br>"Father Andrew Louth offers us an account of Eastern Christianity made up of men and women, flesh and blood, engaged on the extraordinary project of the kingdom of God on earth. The celebrated English Orthodox theologian gives us the chance to meet the living icons for whom Orthodoxy was an existential, rather than confessional, guide. It is an anthology with the secret project of pursuing a tradition of thought that refuses to separate the good, the just and the beautiful. A book to read and re-read." (Antoine Arjakovsky, founding director of the institute of ecumenical studies, Lviv, Ukraine, research director, Coll�ge des Bernardins, Paris)<br><br>"This is a brilliant introduction to the living theology of the Orthodox Church since the publication of the <em>Philokalia</em> in 1782, revealing the amazing diversity and fecundity of the Orthodox theological tradition. This is sure to become the standard handbook on the ways of Orthodox theology in the nineteenth and twentieth century inspired by, and inspiring, the love of the good and beautiful." (John Behr, dean, St. Vladimir's Seminary, New York)<br><br>"This book will be a revelation to those unfamiliar with orthodoxy, and can serve as an excellent introduction. For those already familiar with the general scope of modern orthodox theology, this will be an essential work distinguishing and comparing the variety of orthodox theologians. Highly recommended!"

However, my hope is not only for the enlightenment of my brothers and sisters of Rastafari but that these speeches will also be especially Jews, Christians and Muslims. All students of the Scriptures, who claim the patriarch Abraham. cannot in good conscience ignore the counsel sovereign throne, the throne of David and Solomon. Haile Selassie I and the Royal Family of Ethiopia represent a direct genealogical link to the Bible story and the Davidic throne. The counsel and wisdom handed down to His Majesty by his forefathers, the Biblical Patriarchs, must be just as important to all other students of the Scriptures and history as it is to all Rastafarians.

Much of what has been written about his short life has been distorted and exaggerated, to the point where the most well-known depiction - the 1980 film starring John Hurt - left an indelible imprint of cruelty and suffering at the hands of Joseph's manager, and an eventual rescue by Dr. Frederick Treves of the London Hospital. The truth is rather different. Peeling back the layers of myth, Joanne Vigor-Mungovin has looked into the early life of Merrick and his family in her hometown of Leicester, and here presents, for the first time, detailed information about Joseph's family and his burning ambition to be self-sufficient rather than survive on the charity of others.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Joanne Vigor-Mungovin's interest in Leicester-shire history has seen her spend almost twenty years researching her family tree, in the process discovering that she is related through her maternal line to great grandfathers who were Freemen of the Town of Leicester, and through her paternal line to Tom Norman, the showman who exhibited Joseph Merrick, This led to in-depth research into the Merrick and Potterton families, and life in Leicester at the time Joseph was growing up. For the past three years she has led guided tours around Leicester Cathedral, and has appeared on local East Midlands television, radio and in newspapers supporting the reinternment of King Richard III in Leicester.

In this book, Irving Berlin comes to life as a father, a husband and a friend as well as the most enduring and beloved songwriter of this century. We see his good times and his bad, his public life and his private one. Mary Ellin Barrett, Berlin&#39;s oldest daughter and the author of three previous books, puts her father&#39;s work into perspective and reveals the truth behind certain darker and more mysterious elements of the Irving Berlin no other biographer has understood. &#34;The bulk of the memoir concentrates on the half-century of triumphs that began with Alexander&#39;s Ragtime Band and included White Christmas, God Bless America, and There&#39;s No Business Like Show Business. Touching, wise, gracefully written.&#34; The New York Times</p><p>Life with father, glossing over the bad times and trumpeting the good. Although billed as a memoir of her father, this is really Barrett's story, a recreation of a protected world of family, and friends, and small, youthful follies. Irving Berlin (18881989) was nearly 40 and already a successful songwriter when he eloped with the 23-year-old society belle Ellin MacKay. The story was widely covered because of the disparity in their backgrounds: he, a Lower East Side Jewish immigrant who worked in the lowly field of ``entertainment''; she, the daughter of wealth and privilege, whose Catholic father cut her out of his will when he learned of her marriage. Their first daughter, Mary Ellin, was born 11 months later, in 1926, and this memoir-autobiography primarily covers the period from her childhood to her marriage. Thus, she misses the dramatic story of Berlin's rise to the top as a Broadway composer; indeed, the coverage of Berlin the musician is slight, limited mostly to memories of opening night jitters and faint tinklings coming from the pianist's study. Barrett touches upon her father's early Hollywood years in the late '20s and early '30s, including his famous scores for the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers vehicles Follow the Fleet and Top Hat, his prewar Broadway triumphs, particularly the hit As Thousands Cheer, a detailed account of his World War IIera labor-of-love production of This Is the Army, taking him to the battlefields of Italy and the South Pacific as performer/promoter/songwriter, his postwar hits, including the classic Annie Get Your Gun, and his final slide into retirement. There are glimpses of Berlin's business dealings, but only as distant rumbles that sometimes disturbed domestic life. Berlin is portrayed as an intensely private, troubled man, either manically creative or deeply depressed, suffering from chronic insomnia, who had only a scanty relationship with his daughter. This memoir succeeds on a small scale, as a daughter's reach across time to recapture her childhood and make a final attempt to connect with her father.

All rights reserved.</i>Irving Berlin's (1888-1989) oldest daughter here tells of growing up with the composer of some of America's most popular songs, including "White Christmas," "God Bless America" and "Easter Parade." Barrett (An Accident of Love) details her parents' well-publicized romance and marriage, which scandalized her mother's family, and describes life in a household with a Catholic mother from one of the country's wealthiest families and a Jewish father who earned millions with his music though his parents were penniless Russian immigrants. It was a storybook childhood, with loving parents, governesses and innumerable servants; homes in Los Angeles, the Catskills and New York City; and daily contact with the rich and the famous. Yet there was a dark side: the death of the Berlins' infant son; "dry spells" when the composer could not write; and periods of depression for both him and his wife, culminating in his later years as a virtual recluse. Barrett's bittersweet memoir is affectionate yet candid.

Acclaimed author David Schickler&#x2019;s collection of linked stories follows a troupe of love-hungry urbanites through a charmed metropolis and into the Preemption--a mythic Manhattan apartment building. The Preemption sets the stage for a romantic fantasy as exuberant, dark, and dazzling as the city it occupies. Behind closed doors, the paths of an improbable cast of tenants--a seductive perfume heiress; a crabby, misunderstood actor; a preternaturally sharp-sighted priest--tangle and cross, while a perilous love triangle builds around three characters: <br><br>James Branch, a shy young accountant with an unusual love for the Preemption&#x2019;s antique elevator, and a strange destiny... <br><br>Patrick Rigg, a Wall Street lothario who soothes his pain by seducing <br>beautiful women, carrying a gun, and attending the nightly sermons of a foreboding priest... <br><br>Rally McWilliams, a fetching, hopeful young writer who roams the city at night, searching for the soulmate she believes in but can&#x2019;t find...<br><br>Charged with joy and a deadly sense of humor, <b>Kissing in Manhattan</b> is a daring new writer&#x2019;s vision of a world where men and women, good and evil, love and sex, meet, battle, and embrace on every street corner.</p><p>David Schickler's debut seems at first to be a lot of fun: a gaggle of young Manhattanites with fancy jobs and fine educations chase each other around town, falling in love or not. In a series of linked stories, Schickler gives us a perverted heiress; a bumbling schoolteacher whose teenage student proposes marriage to him; a bad comic who finds his m�tier in off-off-Broadway theater. The writing is cool and a bit willfully naive: "Rally McWilliams was profoundly lonely," begins the title story. "She wanted to believe that she had a soul mate, a future spouse gestating somewhere in Nepal or the Australian Outback. But in Manhattan, where Rally lived, all she found were guys."<p> The mood turns dark, however, with the introduction of Patrick, a thirtysomething Wall Street trader who collects women and spends his evenings tying them up in his room. In short order the book's easy comedy is torqued into something more dramatic by Patrick's descent into violence. That Schickler doesn't play to his strengths is not necessarily a bad thing: one admires a writer who reaches beyond facility to something more difficult. But the transition from lighthearted sexual <i>ronde</i> to dirty realism is a bit bumpy. On the other hand, the novel's picture of a dark, desire-ridden Manhattan is an attractively seductive slice of escapism. The linked-stories format gives rise to a feeling of multiplicity, which is just the right tone for a book about a city crowded with pleasures. Describing James, a love-struck young accountant, Schickler writes: "His mind tonight was on the fine and the illicit pleasures of the planet, on their merits and dispersement. Some people cut daisies, thought James. Some visit Wales, or choose cocaine, or dig latrines for the poor and the weak." Everyone, it seems, is after something different. But it's desire itself that interests the author of <i>Kissing in Manhattan</i>. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>&#x201c;Forget mere sex and the city... <b>Kissing in Manhattan</b><i> </i>features die-hard romantic strivers in a surreal turn-of-the-millennium New York ruled by the spirit of improbable happy endings.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014; <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;Schickler has a wild, out-of-left-field dramatic imagination that&#x2019;s really fresh.

Eve Taggert, desperate with grief over losing her daughter, takes it upon herself to find out the truth about what happened. Eve is no stranger to the dark side of life, having been raised by a hard-edged mother whose lessons Eve tried not to pass on to her own daughter. But Eve may need her mother's cruel brand of strength if she's going to face the reality about her daughter's death and about her own true nature.

And too ordinary to find love . . . Despite her inherited wealth and successful business, Hannah Vaughn considers herself plain and ordinary, a feeling reinforced for years by her now deceased father. Though her dream is to live a simple life, she is convinced that no man will ever love her for herself, and not just for her money. A thousand miles to the northwest, Dovie Ivey is happily married but has suffered through two traumatic pregnancies, each ending in the death of a desperately wanted infant son. Now more than 40 years old and pregnant for what her husband has vowed will be the last time, Dovie is trying her best to trust that God will grant her a healthy child despite the loving warnings of friends who are afraid another loss will devastate her. Farther south, Edward Carroll and his two children, Holly and Neddy, have come to a temporary standstill following the unexpected death of Edward&#x2019;s wife and the children&#x2019;s mother. Her dream was to settle far away in the verdant bush country of Saskatchewan. Now, killed by a rampant influenza, her body lay under a crudely marked grave on the expansive Canadian prairie. Hannah, Dovie. and the Carrolls-all are at a crossroads that will test their fortitude and faith in God. Each faces odds that seem tantamount to certain defeat. These are their stories in this fourth of the Wildrose Series, told in the masterful and captivating way that has become the trademark of Ruth Glover.

It is a wonderful place.&#x2019; The author moved to Vancouver, Wash., in her late teens. It was in Vancouver she met Hal Glover, who fin-ished his term in the Army and married Ruth in 1940. The couple attended Pasadena College (now Point Loma Nazarene College) together, where Rev. Glover earned a master of arts degree. He has pastored churches in California and the northwestern United States for many years, while Mrs. Glover has pursued her love of Christian writing. That love has resulted in contributions to over 50 Christian publications, including the Christian Standard, Decision, the Herald of Holiness, Home Life, Light and Life, the National Christian Reporter, Standard, the Sunday Digest, Vital Christianity, War Cry, and the Wesleyan Advocate.</p><h2>Street Fight in Naples: A City&#39;s Unseen History</h2><p>Naples is always a shock, flaunting beauty and squalor like nowhere else. Naples is the only city in Europe whose ancient past still lives in its irrepressible people. Their ancestors came from all over the early Mediterranean to the wide bay and its islands, shadowed by a dormant volcano. Not all of them found what they were looking for, but they made a great and terribly human city. Peter Robb&#39;s Street Fight in Naples ranges across nearly three thousand years of Neapolitan life and art, from the first Greek landings in Italy to his own less auspicious arrival thirty-something years ago. In 1503 Naples became the Mediterranean capital of Spain&#39;s world empire and the base for the Christian struggle with Islam. It was a European metropolis matched only by Paris and Istanbul, an extraordinary concentration of military power, lavish consumption, poverty and desperation. As the occupying empire went into crisis, exhausted by its wars against Islamists in the Mediterranean and Protestants i</p><p>Peter Robb&#39;s first book, Midnight in Sicily (1996), was a bestseller in Australia and the UK. It won the Victorian Premier&#39;s Prize for Nonfiction in 1997. His book M (1998), about the painter Michelangelo Merisi from Caravaggio, won the same prize, and the National Biography Award, two years later. It was a bestseller in the US and a New York Times Notable Book for 2000. A Death in Brazil (2004) was the Age Nonfiction Book of the Year and won the Queensland Premier&#39;s Award for Nonfiction in 2004. It was longlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize and shortlisted for the Royal Society of Literature Ondaatje Prize. Peter Robb has also published a book of pulp novellas called Pig&#39;s Blood and Other Fluids (1999), which won nothing.Praise for A Death in Brazil:`Sentence after sentence, page after page, with its eye for landscape, ear for character, delicious sensuousness, and bold investigation of political greed, corruption and revolution, A Death in Brazil is an astonishing feat of storytelling' * Peter Carey * 'As good a portrait of Brazil as anything else I have read ... he has managed to capture the country's spirit and paradoxes in a way few other writers have' * Alex Bellos, <i>Guardian</i> * `Robb's fearlessness is one of the key components of his outstanding book. Impossible to corral into a single genre, it draws on travelogue, history, memoir, thriller, investigative journalism and cookery writing. It creates a heady and fascinating picture of an extraordinary country' * <i>Daily Telegraph</i> *</p><h2>The Law of the Land: The Evolution of Our Legal System</h2><p>The Law of the Land: The Evolution of Our Legal System [May 19, 1980] Charles Rembar ...</p><p></p><h2>The NPR Guide to Building a Classical CD Collection: Second Edition, Revised and Updated</h2><p>Berlioz.

With a pre-battle population of fifteen to twenty thousand, Musa Qala was the only significant town held by the Taliban at that time. Attacking against two thousand Taliban fighters, who were heavily dug in after occupying the town for more than nine months, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was spearheaded by Task Force 1 Fury: 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, of the 82nd Airborne Division.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the ISAF Musa Qala &nbsp;was a target of immense importance; the Taliban had to be driven out and the town secured.

Again.</p><p>I clutched the overhead rail by dint of standing on the tippiest bit of my tippy toes. My nose banged into the arm of the man next to me. A Frenchman, judging from the black turtleneck and the fact that his armpit was a deodorant-free zone. Murmuring apologies in my best faux English accent, I tried to squirm out from under his arm, tripped over a protruding umbrella, and stumbled into the denim-covered lap of the man sitting in front of me.</p><p>&#x201c;Cheers,&#x201d; he said with a wink, as I wiggled my way off his leg.</p><p>Ah, &#x201c;cheers,&#x201d; that wonderful multipurpose English term for anything from &#x201c;hello&#x201d; to &#x201c;thank you&#x201d; to &#x201c;nice ass you have there.&#x201d; Bright red (a shade that doesn&#x2019;t do much for my auburn hair), I peered about for a place to hide. But the Tube was packed solid, full of tired, cranky Londoners on their way home from work. There wasn&#x2019;t enough room for a reasonably emaciated snake to slither its way through the crowd, much less a healthy American girl who had eaten one too many portions of fish and chips over the past two months.</p><p>Um, make that about fifty too many portions of fish and chips. Living in a basement flat with a kitchen the size of a peapod doesn&#x2019;t inspire culinary exertions.</p><p>Resuming my spot next to the smirking Frenchman, I wondered, for the five-hundredth time, what had ever possessed me to come to London.</p><p>Sitting in my carrel in Harvard&#x2019;s Widener Library, peering out of my little scrap of window at the undergrads scuttling back and forth beneath the underpass, bowed double under their backpacks like so many worker ants, applying for a fellowship to spend the year researching at the British Library seemed like a brilliant idea. No more student papers to grade! No more hours of peering at microfilm! No more Grant.</p><p>Grant.</p><p>My mind lightly touched the name, then shied away again. Grant. The other reason I was playing sardines on the Tube in London, rather than happily spooling through microfilm in the basement of Widener.</p><p>I ended it with him. Well, mostly. Finding him in the cloakroom of the Faculty Club at the history department Christmas party in a passionate embrace with a giggly art historian fresh out of undergrad did have something to do with it, so I couldn&#x2019;t claim he was entirely without a part in the breakup. But I was the one who tugged the ring off my finger and flung it across the room at him in time-honored, pissed-off female fashion.</p><p>Just in case anyone was wondering, it wasn&#x2019;t an engagement ring.</p><p>The Tube lurched back to life, eliciting a ragged cheer from the other passengers. I was too busy trying not to fall back into the lap of the man sitting in front of me. To land in someone&#x2019;s lap once is carelessness; to do so twice might be considered an invitation.</p><p>Right now, the only men I was interested in were long-dead ones.</p><p>The Scarlet Pimpernel, the Purple Gentian, the Pink Carnation . . . The very music of their names invoked a forgotten era, an era of men in knee breeches and frock coats who dueled with witty barbs sharper than the points of their swords. An era when men could be heroes.</p><p>The Scarlet Pimpernel, rescuing countless men from the guillotine; the Purple Gentian, driving the French Ministry of Police mad with his escapades, and foiling at least two attempts to assassinate King George III; and the Pink Carnation . . . I don&#x2019;t think there was a single newspaper in London between 1803 and 1814 that didn&#x2019;t carry at least one mention of the Pink Carnation, the most elusive spy of them all.</p><p>The other two, the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian, had each, in their turn, been unmasked by the French as Sir Percy Blakeney and Lord Richard Selwick. They had retired to their estates in England to raise precocious children and tell long stories of their days in France over their postdinner port. But the Pink Carnation had never been caught.</p><p>At least not yet.</p><p>That was what I planned to do&#x2014;to hunt the elusive Pink Carnation through the archives of England, to track down any sliver of long-dead gossip that might lead me to what the finest minds in the French government had failed to discover.</p><p>Of course, that wasn&#x2019;t how I phrased it when I suggested the idea to my dissertation advisor.</p><p>I made scholarly noises about filling a gap in the historiography, and the deep sociological significance of spying as a means of asserting manhood, and other silly ideas couched in intellectual unintelligibility. I called it &#x201c;Aristocratic Espionage during the Wars with France: 1789&#x2013;1815.&#x201d;</p><p>Rather a dry title, but somehow I doubt &#x201c;Why I Love Men in Black Masks&#x201d; would have made it past my dissertation committee.</p><p>It all seemed perfectly simple back in Cambridge. There must have been some sort of contact between the three aristocrats who had donned black masks in order to outwit the French; the world of the upper class in early nineteenth-century England was a small one, and I couldn&#x2019;t imagine that men who had all spied in France wouldn&#x2019;t share their expertise with one another. I knew the identities of Sir Percy Blakeney and Lord Richard Selwick&#x2014;in fact, there was a sizable correspondence between those two men. Surely, there would be something in their papers, some slip of the pen that would lead me to the Pink Carnation.</p><p>But there was nothing in the archives. Nothing. So far, I&#x2019;d read twenty years&#x2019; worth of Blakeney estate accounts and Selwick laundry lists. I&#x2019;d even trekked out to the sprawling Public Record Office in Kew, hauling myself and my laptop through the locker rooms and bag searches to get to the early nineteenth-century records of the War Office. I should have remembered that they call it the secret service for a reason. Nothing, nothing, nothing. Not even a cryptic reference to &#x201c;our flowery friend&#x201d; in an official report.</p><p>Getting panicky, because I didn&#x2019;t really want to have to write about espionage as an allegory for manhood, I resorted to my plan of last resort. I sat on the floor of Waterstones, with a copy of Debrett&#x2019;s Peerage open in my lap, and wrote letters to all the surviving descendants of Sir Percy Blakeney and Lord Richard Selwick. I didn&#x2019;t even care if they had access to the family archives (that was how desperate I was getting), I&#x2019;d settle for family stories, half-remembered tales Grandpapa used to tell about that crazy ancestor who was a spy in the 1800s, anything that might give me some sort of lead as to where to look next.</p><p>I sent out twenty letters. I received three responses.</p><p>The proprietors of the Blakeney estate sent me an impersonal form letter listing the days the estate was open to the public; they helpfully included the fall 2003 schedule for Scarlet Pimpernel reenactments. I could think of few things more depressing than watching overeager tourists prancing around in black capes, twirling quizzing glasses, and exclaiming, &#x201c;Sink me!&#x201d;</p><p>The current owner of Selwick Hall was even more discouraging. He sent a letter typed on crested stationery designed to intimidate, informing me that Selwick Hall was still a private home, it was not open to the public in any capacity, and any papers the family intended for the public to view were in the British Library. Although Mr. Colin Selwick did not specifically say &#x201c;sod off,&#x201d; it was heavily implied.</p><p>But all it takes is one, right?</p><p>And that one, Mrs. Arabella Selwick-Alderly, was currently waiting for me at&#x2014;I dug the dog-eared scrap of paper out of my pocket as I scurried up the stairs in the South Kensington Tube station&#x2014;43 Onslow Square.</p><p>It was raining, of course. It generally is when one has forgotten one&#x2019;s umbrella.</p><p>Pausing on the doorstep of 43 Onslow Square, I ran my fingers through my rain-dampened hair and took stock of my appearance. The brown suede Jimmy Choo boots that had looked so chic in the shoe store in Harvard Square were beyond repair, matted with rain and mud. My knee-length herringbone skirt had somehow twisted itself all the way around, so that the zipper stuck out stiffly in front instead of lying flat in back. And there was a sizeable brownish blotch on the hem of my thick beige sweater&#x2014;the battle stain of an unfortunate collision with someone&#x2019;s cup of coffee at the British Library cafeteria that afternoon.</p><p>So much for impressing Mrs. Selwick-Alderly with my sophistication and charm.</p><p>Tugging my skirt right way &#x2019;round, I rang the buzzer. A crackly voice quavered, &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d;</p><p>I leaned on the reply button. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Eloise,&#x201d; I shouted into the metal grating. I hate talking into intercoms; I&#x2019;m never sure if I&#x2019;m pressing the right button, or speaking into the right receiver, or about to be beamed up by aliens. &#x201c;Eloise Kelly. About the Purple Gentian?&#x201d;</p><p>I managed to catch the door just before it stopped buzzing.</p><p>&#x201c;Up here,&#x201d; called a disembodied voice.</p><p>Tipping my head back, I gazed up the stairwell. I couldn&#x2019;t see anyone, but I knew just what Mrs. Selwick-Alderly would look like. She would have a wrinkled face under a frizz of snowy white hair, dress in ancient tweeds, and be bent over a cane as gnarled as her skin. Following the directive from on high, I began up the stairs, rehearsing the little speech I had prepared in my head the night before. I would say something gracious about how lovely it was of her to take the time to see me. I would smile modestly and express how much I hoped I could help in my own small way to rescue her esteemed ancestor from historical oblivion. And I would remember to speak loudly, in deference to elderly ears.</p><p>&#x201c;Poor girl, you look utterly knackered.&#x201d;</p><p>An elegant woman in a navy-blue suit made of nubby wool, with a vivid crimson and gold scarf tied at her neck, smiled sympathetically at me. Her snowy hair&#x2014;that part of my image at least had been correct!&#x2014;was coiled about her head in an elaborate confection of braids that should have been old-fashioned, but on her looked queenly. Perhaps her straight spine and air of authority made her appear taller than she was, but she made me (five feet nine inches if one counts the three-inch heels that are essential to daily life) feel short. This was not a woman with an osteoporosis problem.</p><p>My polished speech dripped away like the drops of water trickling from the hem of my raincoat.</p><p>&#x201c;Um, hello,&#x201d; I stammered.</p><p>&#x201c;Hideous weather today, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Mrs. Selwick-Alderly ushered me through a cream-colored foyer, indicating that I should drop my sodden raincoat on a chair in the hall. &#x201c;How good of you to come all the way from&#x2014;the British Library, was it?&#x2014;to see me on such an inhospitable day.&#x201d;</p><p>I followed her into a cheerful living room, my ruined boots making squelching noises that boded ill to the faded Persian rug. A chintz sofa and two chairs were drawn up around the fire that crackled comfortably away beneath a marble mantelpiece. On the coffee table, an eclectic assortment of books had been pushed aside to make room for a heavily laden tea tray.</p><p>Mrs. Selwick-Alderly glanced at the tea tray and made a little noise of annoyance. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve forgotten the biscuits. I won&#x2019;t be a minute. Do make yourself comfortable.&#x201d;</p><p>Comfortable. I didn&#x2019;t think there was much chance of that. Despite Mrs. Selwick-Alderly&#x2019;s charm, I felt like an awkward fifth-grader waiting for the headmistress to return.</p><p>Hands clasped behind my back, I wandered over to the mantel. It boasted an assortment of family photos, jumbled together in no particular order. At the far right towered a large sepia portrait photo of a debutante with her hair in the short waves of the late 1930s, a single strand of pearls about her neck, gazing soulfully upwards. The other photos were more modern and less formal, a crowd of family photos, taken in black tie, in jeans, indoors and out, people making faces at the camera or each other; they were clearly a large clan, and a close-knit one.</p><p>One picture in particular drew my attention. It sat towards the middle of the mantel, half-hidden behind a picture of two little girls decked out as flower girls. Unlike the others, it only featured a single subject&#x2014;unless you counted his horse. One arm casually rested on his horse&#x2019;s flank. His dark blond hair had been tousled by the wind, and a hard ride. There was something about the quirk of the lips and the clean beauty of the cheekbones that reminded me of Mrs. Selwick-Alderly. But where her good looks were a thing of elegance, like a finely carved piece of ivory, this man was as vibrantly alive as the sun on his hair or the horse beneath his arm. He smiled out of the photo with such complicit good humor&#x2014;as if he and the viewer shared some sort of delightful joke&#x2014;that it was impossible not to smile back.</p><p>Which was exactly what I was doing when my hostess returned with a plate filled with chocolate-covered biscuits.</p><p>I started guiltily, as though I had been caught out in some embarrassing intimacy.</p><p>Mrs. Selwick-Alderly placed the biscuits next to the tea tray. &#x201c;I see you&#x2019;ve found the photos. There is something irresistible about other peoples&#x2019; pictures, isn&#x2019;t there?&#x201d;</p><p>I joined her on the couch, setting my damp herringbone derriere gingerly on the very edge of a flowered cushion. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so much easier to make up stories about people you don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I temporized. &#x201c;Especially older pictures. You wonder what their lives were like, what happened to them. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s part of the fascination of history, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; she said, applying herself to the teapot. Over the rituals of the tea table, the choice of milk or sugar, the passing of biscuits and cutting of cake, we slipped into an easy discussion of English history, and the awkward moment passed.</p><p>At Mrs. Selwick-Alderly&#x2019;s gentle prompting, I found myself rambling on about how I&#x2019;d become interested in history (too many historical novels at an impressionable age), the politics of the Harvard history department (too complicated to even begin to go into), and why I&#x2019;d decided to come to England. When the conversation began to verge onto what had gone wrong with Grant (everything), I hastily changed the subject, asking Mrs. Selwick-Alderly if she had heard any stories about the nineteenth-century spies as a small child.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, dear, yes!&#x201d; Mrs. Selwick-Alderly smiled nostalgically into her teacup. &#x201c;I spent a large part of my youth playing spy with my cousins. We would take it in turns to be the Purple Gentian and the Pink Carnation. My cousin Charles always insisted on playing Delaroche, the evil French operative. The French accent that boy affected! It put Maurice Chevalier to shame. After all these years, it still makes me laugh just to think of it. He would paint on an extravagant mustache&#x2014;in those days, all the best villains had mustaches&#x2014;and put on a cloak made out of one of Mother&#x2019;s old wraps, and storm up and down the lawn, shaking his fist and swearing vengeance against the Pink Carnation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who was your favorite character?&#x201d; I asked, charmed by the image.</p><p>&#x201c;Why, the Pink Carnation, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>We smiled over the rims of our teacups in complete complicity.</p><p>&#x201c;But you have an added interest in the Pink Carnation,&#x201d; Mrs. Selwick-Alderly said meaningfully. &#x201c;Your dissertation, wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh! Yes! My dissertation!&#x201d; I outlined the work I had done so far: the chapters on the Scarlet Pimpernel&#x2019;s missions, the Purple Gentian&#x2019;s disguis...</p></p><h2>Lonely Planet British Language &amp; Culture (Phrasebook)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i></p><p>We're chuffed to bits to present this tour of Ole Blighty's lingo.

"As we approach the 1987 celebration of the centennial of Marcus Garvey's birth, the time seems appropiate for the United States and Jamaican governments to declare null and void the legal proceedings that unjustly sent him to jail in both countries. Nor should a mere 'pardon' suffice, presupposing as it does, the presence of guilt to begin with." --From the Preface.</p><p>A man who stands without equal in the history of the worldwide mobilization of African peoples. For Marcus Garvey did not merely organize the most massive Black movement in the history of the United States of America. He also organized the largest and most successful movement among African people in the Caribbean.Originally published in the 1920s, this is the standard edition of the black leader's writings. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Strays Like Us</h2><p>From the moment Fred (never Winifred!) spots a scruffy little mutt with sad eyes, she knows she&#39;s in big trouble. Toby&#39;s in bad shape, and Fred longs to rescue him from the old man with the mile-long mean streak who lives next door. But Margery -- the straight-talking woman who is fostering Fred -- says going over to their house is against the rules. And since Fred will only be around until her mother comes to grips with her dependence, Fred can&#39;t let herself care too deeply. Not about Toby or Margery or Delia, a new classmate whose insistent friendship surprises Fred at every turn. Because the more Fred lets this lovable band of misfits into her heart, the harder it&#39;ll be to leave them all behind. In this story of loss and love, acclaimed author Cecilia Galante examines life&#39;s difficult choices and how a girl plus the dog she loves can add up to finding family in the most unlikely places.</p><p></p><h2>The Wizard of Op</h2><p>A slightly inept wizard casts his spells which are demonstrated to us through the techniques of optical art.</p><p></p><h2>Sonic Saga Series 4: House of Cards</h2><p>Sonic and Tails--friends no more?!

In this authoritative and engaging biography, Hazel Rowley chronicles Wright's extraordinary journey from a sharecropper's shack in Mississippi to international renown as a writer, fiercely independent thinker, and outspoken critic of racism.<br><br>The child of the fundamentalist South with an eighth-grade education, a self-taught intellectual in the working-class Communist Party of the 1930s, a black man married to a white woman, and an expatriate in France after World War II, Wright was always an outsider. Skillfully interweaving quotations from Wright's writings, Rowley portrays a man who transced the times in which he lived and sought to reconcile opposing cultures in his work. She draws on recently discovered material to shed new light on Wright's relationships with Langston Hughes, Ralph Ellison, and others, and on his self-imposed exile in France (widely blamed for his so-called decline as a writer). In this lively, finely crafted narrative, Wright -- passionate, complex, courageous, and flawed -- comes vibrantly to life.<br></p><p>Born in Mississippi in 1908, the grandson of former slaves, Richard Wright spent his teenage years chopping wood, carrying coal, scrubbing floors, and enduring a thousand indignities. Later, in novels such as <i>Native Son</i> and <i>The Outsider</i> as well as works of journalism and autobiography, he raised profoundly disturbing questions about the "nightmarish jungle" of race relations in contemporary America, offering profoundly pessimistic answers in return.<p> For his troubles, literary historian Hazel Rowley shows in this sweeping biography, Wright earned a large readership--even, for a time, a place on the bestseller lists and the top income-tax bracket. But, because he had joined the Communist Party as a young man, he was also denounced from the floor of the United States Senate--accused of anti-Americanism and even suspected of spying for Moscow--and his books were banned in several states and cities. Wright protested that he had repudiated Marxism years before, bitterly remarking, "The Western world must make up its mind as to whether it hates colored people more than it hates Communists." Eventually, a prophet without honor, he left his native country and lived out the rest of his years in France, where he is buried.</p><p> Rowley draws on a wealth of archival material (as she notes, "Wright kept everything--drafts of manuscripts, letters, photographs, hotel bills, newspaper cuttings") and his body of work to portray the justly angry writer. The result is a welcome contribution to literary and historical studies. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Hazel Rowley </b>is the author of <i>Christina Stead: A Biography</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> notable book.

They are the parents of two adult children and make their home in Illinois.Gr. 3^-6. The latest subject in the Trailblazer Books series is Elizabeth Fry, a Quaker who lived in the early 1800s and fought for prison reform. As in the previous series books, the authors dramatize a historical subject by adding fictionalized children to the cast of characters. After their mother is deported, Betsey and Loren Maxwell are left to their own devices and eventually turn to picking pockets to support themselves. When they are caught and jailed, Elizabeth Fry enters the picture, intervening on their behalf. The characters are flat, with Levy the most convincing, but the book does lend insight into the Quaker faith and its commitment to social causes, and an appended fact section will give kids additional details about Fry's struggles to obtain more humane treatment for prisoners.

In particular, cloth has traditionally been the most significant art form and cultural vehicle of the Aymara and Quechua peoples.

The elaborately patterned pieces are all drawn from the previously unpublished Jeffrey Appleby Collection and include everyday and ceremonial textiles of all types: ponchos, skirts, belts, hats, and slings. The accompanying essays by Lynn Ann Meisch, Amy Oakland Rodman, Ed Franquemont, and Margot Blum Schevill address such topics as the long history of fibers, dyes, imagery, and textile use in the region; and the effects of urbanization and westernization on traditional Andean weaving.</p><p></p><h2>Classical Composition III: Chreia/Maxim Stage Student Book</h2><p>Have you been looking for a composition program that incorporates the classical approach?

Going back to the method of writing instruction used for over 2,000 years, <i>Classical Composition</i> teaches the student 14 composition skills, called the progymnasmata, a set of elementary rhetorical exercises that formed the basis of persuasive writing. This approach was used to teach writing by Quintilian and Cicero, and produced writers such as Milton, Shakespeare, and Benjamin Franklin. <br> This books comes after the Fable and Narrative Stages. &#x201c;Chreia&#x201d; (pronounced cray-a) and &#x201c;Maxim&#x201d; both mean &#x201c;a wise saying&#x201d;. Students will not be learning how to invent their own witty one-liners, but they will learn how to compose a short essay that explains and applies such a saying so that a reader can understand its meaning and consent to follow its wisdom. As the student learns the theory, he will practice inventing good explanatory paragraphs. (The Chreia and Maxim exercises are similar to an expository essay in modern composition theory.)</p><p></p><h2>New Crafts: Basketwork: 25 practical basket-making projects for every level of experience</h2><p><table><tbody><tr><td>This comprehensive course in basket-making techniques includes 25 wonderful projects for crafters of all levels.

She was a stocky woman of less than medium height, wearing a blue slack suit over a blue turtleneck sweater, and a blue mink stole that failed to soften her outlines. Her face was squarish and deeply tanned, its boyish quality confirmed by dark hair cut short at the nape. She wasn&#39;t the type you&#39;d expect to be up and about at eight thirty in the morning, unless she&#39;d been up all night.As I unlocked the door she stood back and looked up at me with the air of an early bird surveying an outsize worm. I said: &#34;Good morning.&#34;&#34;Mr. Archer?&#34;Without waiting for an answer, she offered me a stubby brown hand. Her grip, armed with rings, was as hard as a man&#39;s. Releasing her hand, she placed it behind my elbow, ushered me into my own office, and closed the door behind her.&#34;I&#39;m very glad to see you, Mr. Archer.&#34;She had begun to irritate me already. &#34;Why?&#34;&#34;Why what?&#34;&#34;Why are you glad to see me?&#34;&#34;Because. Let&#39;s sit down and be comfortable so we can talk.&#34; Without charm, her petite willfulness was disquieting.&#34;About anything in particular?&#34;She seated herself in an armchair by the door and looked around the waiting-room. It was neither large nor expensively furnished, and she seemed to be registering those circumstances. Her only comment was to click her ringed fists together in front of her. There were three rings on each hand. They had good-sized diamonds in them, which looked real.&#34;I have a job for you,&#34; she said to the sagging green imitation-leather davenport against the opposite wall. Her manner had changed from girlish vivacity to boyish earnestness. &#34;It&#39;s not what you&#39;d consider a big job, but I&#39;m willing to pay well. Fifty a day?&#34;&#34;And expenses. Who sent you to me?&#34;&#34;But nobody. Do sit down. I&#39;ve known your name for ages, simply ages.&#34;&#34;You have the advantage of me.&#34;Her gaze returned to me, tireder and older after its little slumming excursion around my antechamber. There were olive drab thumbprints under her eyes. Maybe she had been up all night, after all. In any case she looked fifty, in spite of the girlishness and the boyishness. Americans never grew old: they died; and her eyes had guilty knowledge of it.&#34;Call me Una,&#34; she said.&#34;Do you live in Los Angeles?&#34;&#34;Not exactly. Where I live doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;ll tell you what does, if you want me to be blunt.&#34;&#34;I couldn&#39;t bear it if you weren&#39;t.&#34;Her hard dry glance went over me almost tangibly and rested on my mouth. &#34;You look all right. But you sound kind of Hollywood to me.&#34;I was in no mood to swap compliments. The ragged edge on her voice, and her alternation of fair and bad manners bothered me. It was like talking to several persons at once, none of them quite complete.&#34;Protective coloration.&#34; I caught her glance and held it. &#34;I meet a lot of different types.&#34;She didn&#39;t flush. All that happened was that her face looked a little congested for a moment. It passed, and the incomplete boy in her came to the point:&#34;I mean, do you make a habit of cutting your clients&#39; throats? I&#39;ve had some pretty discouraging experiences.&#34;&#34;With detectives?&#34;&#34;With people. Detectives are people.&#34;&#34;You&#39;re full of compliments this morning, Mrs. --&#34; &#34;I said just call me Una. I&#39;m not proud. Can I trust you to do what I want you to do and stop? Take your money and go about your business?&#34;&#34;Money?&#34;&#34;Here.&#34; She produced a crumpled bill from a blue leather pouch and tossed it to me as if it were an old piece of Kleenex and I were a wastebasket. I caught it. It was a hundred-dollar bill, but I didn&#39;t put it away.&#34;A retainer always helps to establish a bond of loyalty,&#34; I said. &#34;I&#39;ll still cut your throat, of course, but I&#39;ll give you sodium pentothal first.&#34;She addressed the ceiling, darkly: &#34;Why does everybody in these parts work so hard for laughs? You haven&#39;t answered my question.&#34;&#34;I&#39;ll do what you want me to do so long as it&#39;s not illegal and makes some kind of sense.&#34;I&#39;m not suggesting anything illegal,&#34; she said sharply. &#34;And I promise you it makes sense.&#34;&#34;All the better.&#34; I tucked the bill into the bill compartment of my wallet, where it looked rather lonely, and opened the door to the inner office.There were three chairs in it, and no room for a fourth. After I had opened the Venetian blinds, I took the swivel chair behind the desk. The armchair I pointed out for her faced me across the desk. Instead, she sat down in a straight chair against the partition, away from the window and the light.Crossing her trousered legs, she pushed a cigarette into a short gold holder and lit it with a squat gold lighter.&#34;About this job I mentioned. I want you to locate a certain person, a colored girl who used to work for me. She left my house two weeks ago, on the first of September to be exact. It was good riddance of bad rubbish as far as I was concerned, only she took along a few little knickknacks of mine. A pair of ruby earrings, a gold necklace.&#34;&#34;Insured?&#34;&#34;No. Actually they&#39;re not very valuable. Their value is sentimental--you know? They mean a lot to me, sentimentally.&#34; She tried to look sentimental and failed.&#34;It sounds like a matter for the police.&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t think so.&#34; Her face closed up solid like brown wood. &#34;You make your living tracing people, don&#39;t you? Are you trying to talk yourself out of a living?&#34;I took the hundred-dollar bill out of my wallet and dropped it on the desk in front of me. &#34;Apparently.&#34;&#34;Don&#39;t be so touchy.&#34; She forced her grim little mouth into a smile. &#34;The truth is, Mr. Archer, I&#39;m a fool about people. Anybody that ever worked for me, even if they took advantage of me--well, I feel responsible for them. I had a very genuine affection for Lucy, and I guess I still have. I don&#39;t wish to make any trouble for her, nothing like that. I wouldn&#39;t dream of sicking the police on Lucy. All I really want is a chance to talk to her, and get my things back. And I was so hoping that you would be able to help me?&#34;She lowered her short bristling lashes over her hard black eyes. Maybe she could hear the music of distant violins. All I could hear was the pushing and hooting of traffic on the Boulevard one story down.&#34;I think you said she was a Negro.&#34;&#34;I have no race prejudice--&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t mean that. Black girls are unfindable in this city. I&#39;ve tried.&#34;&#34;Lucy isn&#39;t in Los Angeles. I know where she is.&#34;&#34;Why don&#39;t you simply go and talk to her?&#34;&#34;I intend to. First I&#39;d like to get some idea of her movements. I want to know who she sees, before I talk to her, and after.&#34;&#34;That&#39;s a pretty elaborate way to go about recovering some jewelry. What&#39;s the purpose?&#34;&#34;It&#39;s none of your business.&#34; She tried to say it gaily and girlishly, but the hostility showed through.&#34;I believe you&#39;re right.&#34; I pushed the bill across the desk towards her, and stood up. &#34;In fact, it sounds like a wildgoose chase. Why don&#39;t you try the classified ads in the Times? There are plenty of investigators who live on a steady diet of wild goose.&#34;&#34;By God, I think the man&#39;s honest.&#34; She spoke to one side as if her alter ego was standing there. &#34;All right, Mr. Archer, you have me, I guess.&#34;The image didn&#39;t excite me, and I registered a suitable apathy.&#34;I mean I&#39;m in a hurry. I haven&#39;t got time to shop around. I&#39;ll even admit that I&#39;m in a spot of trouble.&#34;&#34;Which has nothing to do with petty theft or costume jewelry. You could have thought of a better story. But please don&#39;t try.&#34;&#34;I&#39;m not. This is straight. When Lucy was working in my house she naturally got to know my family affairs. Well, there was bad feeling when she left, not on my side, on hers. There are one or two things that could embarrass me if she decided to spread them. So I want to know who she&#39;s seeing. From that I can draw my own conclusions.&#34;&#34;If I knew a little more about these embarrassing facts--&#34;&#34;I&#39;m not going to tell you, that&#39;s definite. My whole idea in coming to you is to keep them from getting out. Now what could be franker than that?&#34;I still didn&#39;t like her story, but the second version was an improvement over the first. I sat down again. &#34;What sort of work did she do for you?&#34;She hesitated briefly. &#34;General housework. She&#39;s a maid. Her full name is Lucy Champion.&#34;&#34;And where did she work for you?&#34;&#34;In my house, naturally. There&#39;s no reason for you to know where it is.&#34;I swallowed my irritation. &#34;Where is she now, or is that another secret?&#34;&#34;I know I seem unreasonable and suspicious,&#34; she said. &#34;Believe me, I&#39;ve been burned. I take it you&#39;ll do this job for me?&#34;&#34;I might as well.&#34;&#34;She&#39;s in Bella City, up the Valley. You&#39;ll have to hurry to make it before noon. It&#39;s a good two hours from here.&#34;&#34;I know where it is.&#34;&#34;Good. A friend of mine saw her there yesterday, in a restaurant on Main Street near the corner of Hidalgo. My friend talked to the waiter and found out that Lucy eats her lunch there every day between twelve and one. It&#39;s a cornbination cafe and liquor store called Tom&#39;s. You can&#39;t miss it.&#34;&#34;A picture of Lucy would help.&#34;&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; She spread her hands in an automatic gesture that placed her ancestry on the north shore of the Mediterranean. &#34;The best I can do is a description. She&#39;s a handsome girl, and so light she could pass for South American or California Spanish. She has nice big brown eyes, and not too much of a mouth, like some of them. A nice little figure, too, if she wasn&#39;t so skinny.&#34;&#34;How old?&#34;&#34;Not old. Younger than me--than I.&#34; I noticed the self-correction, as well as the self-flattery in the comparison. &#34;In her early twenties, I&#39;d say.&#34;&#34;Hair?&#34;&#34;Black, in a straight bob. She keeps it straight with oil.&#34;&#34;Height?&#34;&#34;A couple of inches taller than I. I&#39;m five foot two.&#34;&#34;Distinguishing characteristics?&#34;&#34;Her legs are her best feature, as she well knows.&#34; Una couldn&#39;t pay another woman an unmixed compliment. &#34;Her nose is sort of turned up--cute, if her nostrils didn&#39;t sort of stare at you.&#34;&#34;What was she wearing when your friend saw her?&#34;&#34;A black-and-white checkered sharkskin suit. That&#39;s how I know it was her. I gave her the suit a couple of months ago. She altered it for herself.&#34;&#34;So you won&#39;t want the suit back.&#34;That seemed to strike a nerve. She removed the butt that had gone out in her holder and crushed it violently in the ashtray beside her chair. &#34;I&#39;ve taken quite a bit from you, mister.&#34;&#34;We&#39;re about even now,&#34; I said. &#34;I&#39;ve been keeping score. I just wouldn&#39;t want you to think that you were buying very much for a hundred bucks. I have to watch that around here. You&#39;re suspicious. I&#39;m touchy.&#34;&#34;You talk as if you were bitten by a bear. Do you have an unhappy home life, by any chance?&#34;&#34;I was just going to ask you about yours.&#34;&#34;Don&#39;t start worrying about my home life. That&#39;s one thing--I don&#39;t want you talking to Lucy.&#34; She had a quick change of mood, or affected one. &#34;Oh hell, it&#39;s my life and I live it. We&#39;re wasting time. Are you willing to do what I say, no more no less?&#34;&#34;No more anyway. She mightn&#39;t turn up at the restaurant today. If she does, I tail her, keep a record of where she goes, who she sees. And report to you?&#34;&#34;Yes. This afternoon if possible. I&#39;ll be registered at the Mission Hotel in Bella City. Ask for Mrs. Larkin.&#34; She glanced at the square gold watch on her right wrist. &#34;You better get going. If she leaves town let me know immediately, and stay with her.&#34;She moved deliberately and quickly to the outer door. Her walk was the shortest distance between things she wanted. The back of her neck was heavy under the cropped hair, swollen with muscle as if she had often used it for buffing and rooting. Turning at the door to lift a flashing hand in good-bye, she hitched the mink stole higher. I wondered if she used it to conceal that telltale grossness.I went back to my desk and dialed the switchboard of my answering service. Standing by the window, I could see the sidewalk below through the slats of the Venetian blind. It swarmed with a bright young crowd of guys and girls buzzing and fluttering in pursuit of happiness and the dollar.Una emerged among them, dark and foreshortened by the height from which I was watching her. She turned uphill, her head thrust forward on her heavy neck, like an irresistible force searching for an irmnovable object. The switchboard answered in a youthful female gurgle on the fifth ring. I told it I was going out of town for the weekend.CHAPTER 2:From the top of the grade I could see the mountains on the other side of the valley, leaning like granite slabs against the blue tile sky. Below me the road meandered among brown September hills spattered with the ink-blot shadows of oaks. Between these hills and the further mountains the valley floor was covered with orchards like vivid green chenille, brown corduroy ploughed fields, the thrifty patchwork of truck gardens. Bella City stood among them, a sprawling dusty town miniatured and tidied by clear space. I drove down into it.The packing houses of the growers&#39; associations stood like airship hangars on the edge of the green fields. Parched nurseries and suburban ranchos offered tomato plants and eggs and lima beans for sale. There was a roadside traffic of filling stations, drive-ins, motels slumping dejectedly under optimistic names. In the road the big trucks went by in both directions, trailing oil smoke and a long loud raspberry for Bella City.The highway was a rough social equator bisecting the community into lighter and darker hemispheres. Above it in the northern hemisphere lived the whites who owned and operated the banks and churches, clothing and grocery and liquor stores. In the smaller section below it, cramped and broken up by ice plants, warehouses, laundries, lived the darker ones, the Mexicans and Negroes who did most of the manual work in Bella City and its hinterland. I remembered that Hidalgo Street ran parallel to the highway and two blocks below it.It was fairly hot and very dry. The dryness ached in my sinuses. Main Street was loud and shiny with noon traffic moving bumper to bumper. I turned left on East Hidalgo Street and found a parking space in the first block. Housewives black, brown, and sallow were hugging parcels and pushing shopping carts on the sidewalk. Above them a ramshackle house, with paired front windows like eyes demented by earthquake memories, advertised Rooms for Transients on one side, Palm Reading on the other. A couple of Mexican children, boy and girl, strolled by hand in hand in a timeless noon on their way to an early marriage.</p><h2>Raven&#39;s Exile: A Season on the Green River</h2><p>The author chronicles a season on the Green River in Utah&#39;s red-rock canyon country, describing her impressions of the region from a series of rafting trips</p><p>Winner of the Western Writers of America Spur Award <p>More than a century after John Wesley Powell launched his boat on the Green River, Ellen Meloy spent eight years of seasonal floats through Utah's Desolation Canyon with her husband, a federal river manager.

It is hard not to laugh and cry...this book will become a classic, a must-read for anyone interested in China." --Fox Butterfield, <i>The New York Times</i><p>"This superb memoir is like no other account of life in China under both Mao and Deng...Her description of the events at Tiananmen Square, which occurred on her watch, is, like the rest of the book, unique, powerful and moving." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)</p><p>"Immensely entertaining and enlightening...tellingly detailed recollections of the journeys of an observant and engaged traveller through interesting times." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)</p><p></p>Jan Wong, a Canadian of Chinese descent, went to China as a starry-eyed Maoist in 1972 at the height of the Cultural Revolution. A true believer--and one of only two Westerners permitted to enroll at Beijing University--her education included wielding a pneumatic drill at the Number One Machine Tool Factory. In the name of the Revolution, she renounced rock and roll, hauled pig manure in the paddy fields, and turned in a fellow student who sought her help in getting to the United States. She also met and married the only American draft dodger from the Vietnam War to seek asylum in China.<p><i>Red China Blues</i> begins as Wong's startling--and ironic--memoir of her rocky six-year romance with Maoism that began to sour as she became aware of the harsh realities of Chinese communism and led to her eventual repatriation to the West. Returning to China in the late eighties as a journalist, she covered both the brutal Tiananmen Square crackdown and the tumultuous era of capitalist reforms under Deng Xiaoping. In a wry, absorbing, and often surreal narrative, she relates the horrors that led to her disillusionment with the "worker's paradise." And through the stories of the people--an un-happy young woman who was sold into marriage, China's most famous dissident, a doctor who lengthens penises--Wong creates an extraordinary portrait of the world's most populous nation. In setting out to show readers in the Western world what life is like in China, and why we should care, Wong reacquaints herself with the old friends--and enemies--of her radical past, and comes to terms with the legacies of her ancestral homeland.</p></p><h2>Someone Else&#39;s Skin: Introducing Detective Inspector Marnie Rome (Detective Inspector Marnie Rome, 1)</h2><p><b>Winner of&nbsp;the Theakstons Old Peculier Crime Novel of the Year Award and Nominated for a Macavity Award for Best First Mystery Novel<br></b><br>No two victims are alike.<br><br>DI Marnie Rome knows this better than most. Five years ago, her family home was the scene of a shocking and bloody crime that left her parents dead and her foster brother in prison. Marnie doesn&#x2019;t talk much about her personal life, preferring to focus on work. Not even her partner, DS Noah Jake, knows much about Marnie&#x2019;s past.

A crowd of witnesses in the domestic violence shelter where she&#x2019;s staying saw it happen, but none of them are telling quite the same story, and the simple question remains: how did Leo Proctor get in to the secure shelter? Marnie and Noah shouldn&#x2019;t even have been there when it happened but they were interviewing another resident, Ayana Mirza. They&#x2019;re trying to get Ayana to testify against her brothers for pouring bleach on her face for bringing dishonor the family, and blinding her in one eye. But Ayana knows that her brothers are looking for her, and she has no doubt that they&#x2019;ll kill her this time.<br><br>As the violence spirals, engulfing the residents of the women's shelter, Marnie finds herself drawn into familiar territory: A place where the past casts long shadows and she must tread carefully to survive.</p><p><b>Sarah Hilary</b> lives with her daughter in Bath, where she writes copy for a well-known travel publisher. She has also worked as a bookseller, and with the Royal navy. An award-winning short story writer, Sarah won the Cheshire Prize for Literature in 2012. SOMEONE ELSE'S SKIN is her first novel.<b>Five years ago</b><p>They&#x2019;ve cordoned off the house by the time she gets home. A uniformed stranger is unwinding police tape, methodically.</p><p>Marnie watches from the safety of the car, her fingers icy on the ignition key, the engine running as if she might make a quick getaway, drive past and keep driving . . .</p><p>She knows she won&#x2019;t get through the police cordon, but she also knows she has to. Whatever else is in the house &#x2013; and she&#x2019;s scared, so scared her teeth ache &#x2013; answers are in there. She needs to get inside.</p><p>She cuts the engine, burying the keys in her fist, their teeth biting the hollow pocket of her palm. She&#x2019;s shivering before she&#x2019;s out of the car.</p><p>An ambulance, there&#x2019;s an ambulance, but it&#x2019;s standing silent, no sirens or sweeping lights. The crew&#x2019;s in the house, no one&#x2019;s in a hurry to leave. That&#x2019;s not good. It means there isn&#x2019;t any hope, the worst possible thing has happened. Her face is wet and she looks for rain, but the sky&#x2019;s empty, grey, as if someone has dragged a tarpaulin across it. There&#x2019;s no rain, just the dull, raspy pressure that comes before a storm.</p><p>It&#x2019;s been raining all month. Like the rest of London, she&#x2019;s got used to it; there&#x2019;s an umbrella in her glove compartment, another in her desk back at the station, and in the bag at her shoulder. She&#x2019;s not going to get wet queuing for coffee or coming out of the tube station, or standing around at crime scenes. Be prepared isn&#x2019;t a motto, it&#x2019;s common sense. When you can pull it off. When it&#x2019;s not something so huge and horrible you&#x2019;re afraid to get close.</p><p>She looks for the PCSO.</p><p>There, wearing a fluorescent vest over his uniform by the side of Dad&#x2019;s car, the brown Vauxhall, his pride and joy. The car manages to shine even without the sun, like the windows to the house, dazzling her. As if everything behind the tape is made of glass, breakable. Even the hanging basket of petunias over the door. Breakable.</p><p>Marnie stands on the pavement, her teeth knocking together with cold, knowing she has to get into the house, knowing she can&#x2019;t.</p><p>She&#x2019;s fourteen again, home late, hoping to sneak in under her parents&#x2019; radar. Her eyes are itchy with mascara, her tongue dry and patchy with tequila. It feels like a snake&#x2019;s crawled inside her left boot and strangled her toes to sleep. She&#x2019;s limping, heroic and guilt-stricken. She&#x2019;ll never make it in there alive . . .</p><p>She shakes herself back into the present. She&#x2019;s not fourteen. She&#x2019;s twenty-eight, petrified of what she&#x2019;s going to find on the other side of the police cordon. Silence, and that dark zoo stink that&#x2019;ll be in her clothes for hours and on her skin for longer.</p><p>She forces herself to think of something else. A different crime scene, one she&#x2019;s survived, worse than whatever&#x2019;s waiting in the house. Albie Crane . . .</p><p>She thinks of Albie Crane. A homeless old man, no next of kin. Burned alive in a doorway down by the docks, by kids high on pocket-money-priced pills. Back before the rain started, while it was still dry enough for an old coat and six flattened cardboard boxes to burn all night so that what&#x2019;s left is a sticky mess of flayed ribs, a blackly lacquered skull. Old Albie Crane with no one to cry for him, and she made herself repeat the lie, &#x2018;He was sleeping when it happened,&#x2019; as if you could sleep through a thing like that. The worst she&#x2019;d seen, or smelt, until the next thing: a couple in a house fire, melted together by the flames.</p><p>The PCSO is young enough to have acne, but it doesn&#x2019;t make any difference. He&#x2019;s in charge here. He could stop the Chief Constable crossing that line.</p><p>Something &#x2013; a breeze, traffic &#x2013; makes the police tape stiffen and turn. The sound it makes is snick-snick-snick.</p><p>The edge of her eye catches Mrs Poole, her parents&#x2019; neighbour, huddled in the porch of number 12. Her face is spotty with shock and there&#x2019;s a foil blanket around her shoulders, but no one is with her. All the action is next door. No one else is hurt, or the cordon would be wider.</p><p>Normally, that would be a comfort, the fact that the damage is contained. Private.</p><p>Seeing Marnie, Mrs Poole moans, a hand coming up to hide her mouth.</p><p>Marnie ducks to pass under the tape.</p><p>&#x2018;Miss. You can&#x2019;t go in there.&#x2019; Up close, the acne is lurid, red and yellow. The PCSO squares up to her, authority lending him an inch in all directions.</p><p>She shows her badge, remembering too late that after the DS, it gives her surname. Rome, like the couple in the house. DS Marnie Rome. Greg and Lisa&#x2019;s little girl.</p><p>A big hand on her shoulder makes her jump.</p><p>Tim Welland, her boss.</p><p>Now she knows it&#x2019;s as bad as it gets.</p><p>&#x2018;DS Rome,&#x2019; he says quietly. &#x2018;Marnie.&#x2019;</p><p>Using her first name. It&#x2019;s worse, much worse.</p><p>&#x2018;Please.&#x2019; She just wants to get inside the house. She&#x2019;s shaking with cold out here. &#x2018;Sir, please . . .&#x2019;</p><p>He steers her with his hand on her shoulder, back towards the tape. She feels it tap the waist of her shirt. &#x2018;Sir . . .&#x2019;</p><p>Welland has a scab above his left eyebrow, too high to be a shaving scar. It&#x2019;s crusty, ringed like a bull&#x2019;s eye. Red veins spoil the whites of his eyes. He looks ill. Old.</p><p>&#x2018;Let me go in,&#x2019; she says. &#x2018;Please. Let me go in to them.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not yet. Not &#x2013; yet.&#x2019;</p><p>He holds her in place with his bear&#x2019;s paw, but he can&#x2019;t stop her seeing past his shoulder to where a SOCO is coming out, bloody knees to his white overalls and a polybag held in front of him, at arm&#x2019;s length.</p><p>A knife. Mum&#x2019;s bread knife, its steel teeth full of tattered red skin.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a low noise of protest, like an animal in chronic pain, before a dry barking sob. Marnie can&#x2019;t stand it, wants to block her ears, but it&#x2019;s her mouth she needs to block; the sound&#x2019;s coming out of her.</p><p>Welland lowers her to the kerb. She fights him. She&#x2019;s not this person. She won&#x2019;t be this person &#x2013; the one who collapses and weeps at the roadside, who can&#x2019;t take the knock on the door, who falls and never gets back up again.</p><p>The victim. She won&#x2019;t be the victim.</p><p>&#x2018;Take a minute, Detective.&#x2019; Welland&#x2019;s hand is heavy on the back of her neck. She has no choice but to put her forehead on her knees. &#x2018;Just . . . take a minute.&#x2019;</p><p><b>PART 1<br>1 </b></p><b>Now</b><p>From the road, DI Marnie Rome&#x2019;s flat was stucco-fronted, very neat and narrow. Noah Jake imagined she&#x2019;d furnished it plainly, with an eye for functional style. Wooden shutters at the windows, a stone-coloured vase filled with upright orange flowers. A hall-floor flat, two bedrooms, Noah guessed. He was curious to see inside, but not enough to make a nuisance of himself, resting his hands on the steering wheel instead and waiting, seeing the light lift from the stucco as the sun broke through London&#x2019;s cloud cover.</p><p>Some days it was easy to remember the city was built on plague pits. Nothing stood still, not even the road, throbbing with traffic from the main drag into the West End. He&#x2019;d read somewhere &#x2013; probably in one of Dan&#x2019;s exhibition guides &#x2013; that Primrose Hill had narrowly missed being a mass graveyard; nineteenth-century plans were drawn up for a multi-storey pyramid taller than St Paul&#x2019;s, to house five million of the city&#x2019;s dead. This was back when the town planners were obsessed with Egyptology, hurling hieroglyphs at everything, on the advice of returning tomb-raiders. Now it was the all-seeing London Eye that dominated the city&#x2019;s skyline, its spindle like a church spire, turning.</p><p>Noah checked his watch, and then the flat.</p><p>DI Rome&#x2019;s front door was dark blue, glossy. Like her eyes. The kind of door with deadlocks. In another minute, she&#x2019;d be running late. He&#x2019;d never known her to run late. Should he knock on the door? No, that&#x2019;d be intrusive. He hadn&#x2019;t learned much about Marnie Rome in the five months he&#x2019;d been working with her, but he&#x2019;d learned that she was an intensely private person.</p><p>The blue door opened in any case, before her minute was up. She came down the steps to the car, wearing a dark trouser suit over a white shirt, a tooled leather bag at one shoulder. Everything about her was neat, from her short red curls to her low heels.</p><p>Noah checked the passenger seat of the car, even though he knew it was clean, dusting the sleeves of his suit in the hope it would pass muster. He reached across to push open the door for her. &#x2018;Morning.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Good morning.&#x2019; She slipped into the car, dropping her bag on the floor. &#x2018;You were lucky with the parking.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I got here early, thought we&#x2019;d better not be late.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You thought right.&#x2019;</p><p>Noah started the engine, waiting for Marnie to put on her seat belt.</p><p>She saw him waiting and smiled, fastening the belt with extravagant care. &#x2018;Safety first, Detective.&#x2019;</p><p>� � �</p><p>Safe was the last thing Noah Jake felt, half an hour later, looking at the photographs on OCU Commander Tim Welland&#x2019;s desk.</p><p>&#x2018;Nasif Mirza.&#x2019; Welland tossed down the photos, one after another, as if he was dealing a pack of cards. &#x2018;A person of interest in a serious assault. Involving a scimitar, in case that wasn&#x2019;t clear yet.&#x2019; The photos made his desk look like the storyboard for a horror film. A glossy 18-certificate horror film with DVD-extra deleted scenes.</p><p>Marnie Rome picked up a photo and studied it before putting it back down. Noah kept his hands out of sight, under the lip of the desk.</p><p>Welland said, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re looking at what&#x2019;s left of Lee Hurran&#x2019;s right arm.&#x2019;</p><p>What was left was yellow, knuckled by fat, frilled by torn flesh. The scimitar had severed Hurran&#x2019;s hand at the wrist. Not a clean amputation; it had taken two or three blows to get the hand off, the raw stump of wrist bone splintered by the impact.</p><p>Noah&#x2019;s palms prickled with sweat. It was stiflingly hot in this office; Tim Welland was in remission from skin cancer and kept the heating turned up all year round. Immune to the heat, Welland never broke a sweat. Nor did Marnie Rome. Noah glanced in her direction, seeing the crisp edge of her shirt, the cool skin of her neck. A bead of perspiration inched its way between his shoulder blades, itching.</p><p>&#x2018;Hurran won&#x2019;t give evidence. Popular theory is that he&#x2019;s scared of losing his other hand, or possibly his balls.&#x2019; Welland nodded at the photos. &#x2018;Nasif isn&#x2019;t fussy when it comes to butchery.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Hurran&#x2019;s still in hospital.&#x2019; Marnie&#x2019;s eyes flicked across the litter of photos. &#x2018;They&#x2019;re monitoring for infection. There was a lot of dirt in the wound . . . Maybe he&#x2019;ll feel safer when he&#x2019;s back home.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Home being the shithole estate where they found him? I tend to doubt that.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;We have the scimitar. With Mirza&#x2019;s prints on it. That&#x2019;s no good?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not even close. The Crown Prosecution Service,&#x2019; Welland served each syllable as if it was an individually foul taste in his mouth, &#x2018;need more evidence before they&#x2019;ll make a move against Nasif. Apparently this . . . dog&#x2019;s dinner isn&#x2019;t enough.&#x2019;</p><p>Marnie picked up the worst of the photos for a closer look. Noah wished he had her backbone for this part of the job. He was too easily disgusted, needed to toughen up, get used to seeing things like this. Things like . . .</p><p>Lee Hurran&#x2019;s hand, half eaten. By rats, or a feral cat. The hand wasn&#x2019;t found in the warehouse where the attack happened. Nasif Mirza, or someone, had tossed it over a wall, into a fly-tipped piece of scrubland.</p><p>&#x2018;Ayana Mirza . . .&#x2019; Marnie started to say.</p><p>&#x2018;CPS wants a statement from her,&#x2019; Welland said, &#x2018;about her brother&#x2019;s violent temperament. Better still, they&#x2019;d like her to press charges for what was done to her.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;We can arrest Nasif without her testimony.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;For this?&#x2019; Welland pointed at the photographs. &#x2018;Or the other thing?&#x2019;</p><p>Noah didn&#x2019;t want to think about the other thing &#x2013; what Nasif Mirza had done to his sister, in their family home. The pictures of Hurran&#x2019;s half-eaten hand were bad enough.</p><p>Neither he nor Marnie had met Ayana Mirza. They&#x2019;d inherited the case from another department, a casualty of the recent public-sector cuts.</p><p>&#x2018;CPS is cagey about the chances of bringing Nasif to trial,&#x2019; Welland said. &#x2018;Other prints on the scimitar, the chance it was stolen, blah-blah. They think Ayana&#x2019;s evidence might swing it. She&#x2019;s a walking testament to Nasif&#x2019;s worst tendencies.

You might have heard accusations that your own government was "soft on Communism." Congress had determined that your children must include the phrase "under God" when reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. The Cincinnati Reds had changed their name, briefly, to "Redlegs" to avoid confusion with any other "Reds." In Indiana, some citizens considered removing copies of <em>The Adventures of Robin Hood</em> from libraries because the story's subversive message encouraged robbing from the rich to give to the poor. These developments grew out of the broad anxiety over communism which characterized the McCarthy era.<br> Recent years have witnessed a flood of books on various aspects of "McCarthyism," but generally these works have slighted the complete story of the origins and development of this broad phenomenon in favor of the particular. Now comes Richard M. Fried's lively <em>Nightmare in Red</em> to offer the first well-balanced, complete account of the entire era. The book uncovers the origins of extremist anti-communism in the troubled 1930s and traces it beyond the censure of Senator McCarthy to its lingering demise in the late 50s and 60s.<br> Fried presents an engaging narrative about the many different people who became involved in the drama of the anti-communist fervor, passing chronologically from the New Deal era and World War II, to the early years of the Cold War, through the peak of the McCarthy era, and beyond that to the decline of the House Committee on Un-American Activities in the 1960s. Along the way, we meet the familiar figures of the era--Wisconsin Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, and Eisenhower, and the young Richard Nixon. But more importantly, Fried also shows us how thousands of ordinary people--from teachers and lawyers to college students, factory workers, and janitors--were affected by McCarthyism. Along with the famous cases such as the Hollywood Ten (which led to the entertainment world's notorious blacklist) and the Alger Hiss case, Fried recounts a wealth of little-known but telling episodes involving victims and victimizers of anti-communist politics at the state and local levels.<br> Providing the most rounded history of the rise and fall of the phenomenon we call McCarthyism, <em>Nightmare in Red</em> extends back into the 1930s and forward past McCarthy's censure, revealing the roots of McCarthyism as well as traces of it that remain today. This wide-ranging study provides a highly original account of the impact of anti-communism in mid-century American politics and culture.</p><p>Providing the most complete history of the rise and fall of the phe-nomenon known as McCarthyism, Nightmare in Red offers a riveting and comprehensive account of the many different people who became embroiled in the anti-communist fervor of mid-century America. It traces the second Red Scare&#39;s antecedents from the 1930s, to the early years of the Cold War, through the peak of the McCarthy era, and beyond McCarthy&#39;s censure to the decline of the House Committee on Un-American Activities in the 1960s.<br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Richard M.

Epic peril, sacrifice, and tragedy prepared Americans to celebrate that holiday with a spirituality that underlies the true meaning of Christmas. Christmas 1945 was a time of healing. The war had been over for four months and the sacrifices made by victors and vanquished alike resulted in a scarcity of goods commonly used for the Christmas holiday. In Europe and Asia, for those who celebrated, food for the banquet table was scarce, and in the United States, gifts for the stocking were not readily available. Those who celebrated Christmas found a joy in celebrating by turning to their neighbors in need and to the church pew to give thanks. It was a holiday that found expression in good will toward mankind. Christmas in 1945 was a four-day event. President Truman proclaimed it so for the Federal employees, mostly out-of-towners, who had held fast to their desks during the Christmases of the four dark years of war, and the nation followed. The war-weary military participated in the Christmas celebration too. Operation Magic Carpet and Operation Santa Claus, the former to return tens of thousands of peacekeeping troops home, the latter to discharge them in time to be home for the holiday in a high-spirited rush that jammed train stations, bus depots, and airports, creating, at that time, the biggest traffic jam in the nation&#x2019;s history The press too, contributed substantially to the great celebration. At the time, information flow was provided by wire- connected newspapers that brought homes, communities, and towns together. When the hearts of American citizens were tapped for their intrinsic goodness, it was the newspaper, ever on hand for a good human interest story, that enthusiastically reported it. Numerous streams of affection, love, and &#x201c;good will toward men&#x201d; were brought to public attention by the press sharing the nation&#x2019;s abundant Christmas spirit with its readers. This book is about that special Christmas when reaching out to the less fortunate, the grieving, and the wounded played a larger role than opening a present under a tree.</p><p>The grinch stole Christmas 1945 AND SANTA IS WORKING TO BRING IT BACK!</p><h2>Lessons from the Classroom 20 Things Good Teachers Do</h2><p>A timeless treasury for teachers full of common sense, wisdom, and practical strategies.

Perfect for any Easter basket.</p><p>Mary Joslin is the author of a number of storybooks for children. She draws her inspiration from the world&#39;s heritage of myths and legends to create new tales which seek to explore the wonder and mystery of the world. Mary lives in a village on the Thames. Like Clara in her book The Shore Beyond, she paddles a small boat on the river!Kindergarten-Grade 3 This attractive retelling of the Easter story mirrors this team's <i>On That Christmas Night</i> (Good Bks, 2005). In straightforward prose, the author relates the events leading up to the crucifixion and resurrection, beginning with Jesus's triumphant arrival into Jerusalem. Each spread is devoted to a key scene. Joslin incorporates dialogue and descriptive imagery about the setting, such as the jingling coins in the temple and the hundred flickering lamps that illuminate the faces of Jesus's accusers, to bring the story to life. Interesting details about the culture of the time also enrich the writing. The inspirational narrative highlights Jesus's actions and his lessons of love and forgiveness, touching only briefly on the role of his disciples. The graceful illustrations, which are framed by decorative borders, reflect the emotions elicited by each scene through the expressive faces of the biblical figures and the color palette. One slight drawback, however, is the placement of the text within the framed illustrations, because the typeface does not stand out against some of the darker shades. Overall, though, this pleasing celebration of the New Testament story is a fine addition to most collections.<i> Linda L.

Sifting through some 15,000 letters from government and private sources, Robert McElvaine has culled nearly 200 communications that best show the problems, thoughts, and emotions of ordinary people during this time.<br><br>Unlike views of Depression life "from the bottom up" that rely on recollections recorded several decades later, this book captures the daily anguish of people during the thirties. It puts the reader in direct contact with Depression victims, evoking a feeling of what it was like to live through this disaster.<br><br>Following Franklin D. Roosevelt's inauguration, both the number of letters received by the White House and the percentage of them coming from the poor were unprecedented. The average number of daily communications jumped to between 5,000 and 8,000, a trend that continued throughout the Rosevelt administration. The White House staff for answering such letters--most of which were directed to FDR, Eleanor Roosevelt, or Harry Hopkins--quickly grew from one person to fifty.<br><br>Mainly because of his radio talks, many felt they knew the president personally and could confide in him. They viewed the Roosevelts as parent figures, offering solace, help, and protection. Roosevelt himself valued the letters, perceiving them as a way to gauge public sentiment. The writers came from a number of different groups--middle-class people, blacks, rural residents, the elderly, and children. Their letters display emotional reactions to the Depression--despair, cynicism, and anger--and attitudes toward relief.<br><br>In his extensive introduction, McElvaine sets the stage for the letters, discussing their significance and some of the themes that emerge from them. By preserving their original spelling, syntax, grammar, and capitalization, he conveys their full flavor.<br><br>The Depression was far more than an economic collapse. It was the major personal event in the lives of tens of millions of Americans. McElvaine shows that, contrary to popular belief, many sufferers were not passive victims of history. Rather, he says, they were "also actors and, to an extent, playwrights, producers, and directors as well," taking an active role in trying to deal with their plight and solve their problems.<br><br>For this twenty-fifth anniversary edition, McElvaine provides a new foreword recounting the history of the book, its impact on the historiography of the Depression, and its continued importance today.<br><br><br><br></p><p>"There's nothing more deeply moving than reading the words and thus hearing the voices of the actual survivors of hard times.

What might be forgiven? And who&#x2014;given the inevitable, knotty complications&#x2014;is desirable still?<br><br>From such questions, and using all the surprising, sophisticated ingredients of a delightful farce, Julian Barnes has created a tragicomedy of human frailties and needs. <b>Love, etc.</b> stars three characters introduced a decade ago in <i>Talking It Over</i>&#x2014;to which this novel has an eerie, freestanding relation. Which is precisely how Stuart feels toward Gillian, his wife before his witty, feckless, former best friend Oliver stole her away. True, he did make a fuss at their subsequent wedding, and spied on them in their French village; but he was agreeable about the divorce, moved to America, remarried briefly, prospered, then returned to London shortly after Oliver and Gillian, <i>avec les enfants</i>, did. <br>Meanwhile, Oliver&#x2019;s artistic ambitions have turned to ashes in his mouth, so it&#x2019;s Gillian supporting the household&#x2014;until Stuart rejoins them.<br><br>What transpires to further complicate the situation doesn&#x2019;t bear repeating, especially as the three principals (along with many others) are allowed to speak directly to the reader, to whisper their secrets and argue their own particular versions of what actually happened, and why. Indeed, emerging from this crux are a number of truths we all live by: faith and generosity, trust and commitment, toward ourselves and our loved ones; or, absent those, banality and even brutality. <br><br>Every bit as funny and intelligent as anything Julian Barnes has written, <b>Love, etc.</b> is also fabulously engaging, powerfully dramatic, and profoundly unsettling.</p><p>Oliver, Stuart, and Gillian have been friends and lovers. But it's been 10 years since this backbiting trio, which Julian Barnes first introduced in <i>Talking It Over</i>, last met--and a lot has changed. For starters, Oliver has married Gillian, and Stuart, his erstwhile best friend, hates him for it. Not just because Stuart was once married to Gillian, but because he still loves her and has never ceased to regard himself as her savior. Under the guise of repairing old friendships--"all blood under the bridge"--this mild-mannered third wheel insinuates himself into the couple's life by offering advice, providing support, and even giving Oliver a job. Once he's maneuvered his nemesis into a crippling depression, Stuart unveils his master plan.<p> In <i>Love, Etc.</i> Barnes adopts the same technique he used in the earlier installment, allowing his characters to speak their innermost thoughts and secrets directly to the reader--and just about everybody gets some good lines. (Oliver: "Yes, everything went swimmingly, which is a very peculiar adverb to apply to a social event, considering how most human beings swim.") But the book is also a bewitchingly intimate excursion into betrayal and jealousy. With painstaking detail, Barnes creates a vibrant portrait of a modern love triangle--as funny as it is cruel, as absurd as it is deep. Few contemporary writers can portray Middle England, with all its temptations, so darkly. <i>--Matthew Baylis</i></p>Twice shortlisted for the Booker Prize, Julian Barnes continues to reinvigorate the novel with his pyrotechnic verbal skill and playful manipulation of plot and character. In Love, etc. he uses all the surprising, sophisticated ingredients of a delightful farce to create a tragicomedy of human frailties and needs. <br>After spending a decade in America as a successful businessman, Stuart returns to London and decides to look up his ex-wife Gillian. Their relationship had ended years before when Stuart's witty, feckless, former best friend Oliver stole her away. But now Stuart finds that the intervening years have left Oliver's artistic ambitions in ruins and his relationship with Gillian on less than solid footing. When Stuart begins to suspect that he may be able to undo the results of their betrayal, he resolves to act. Written as an intimate series of crosscutting monologues that allow each character to whisper their secrets and interpretations directly to the reader, Love, etc. is an unsettling examination of confessional culture and a profound refection on the power of perspective.</p><h2>Letters from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci&#39;s Discovery of America</h2><p>Gathers Vespucci&#39;s six letters about his voyages to the New World, as well as a letter by Columbus about him</p><p></p><h2>Julius Caesar</h2><p>This respected edition of Shakespeare&#39;s play contains the full text, extensive notes and supplementary material written for school use.</p><p>John Dover Wilson&#39;s New Shakespeare, published between 1921 and 1966, became the classic Cambridge edition of Shakespeare&#39;s plays and poems until the 1980s.

Smith, the son of an entrepreneur who sold his bus company to Greyhound and who then ran a series of restaurants successfully, served with distinction in Vietnam before he put into operation the delivery company he conceived at Yale in 1970. In the process of raising money, he was accused of forging papers to save FedEx from bankruptcy; later he was acquitted on criminal charges of bank fraud. Once the company became established, its annual income moved into the stratospheric range, with a gross of $7.7 billion in 1991.

This new edition embraces the wealth of information published on bumblebee life history, ecology, foraging, parasites and conservation in recent years. It includes a new chapter on the very real threats to bumblebees; their crucial role as pollinators of our native flora and crops; ways to promote their survival; advantages and problems posed by their commercial use; as well as updated colour plates, keys and distribution maps of all British species (including Bombus hypnorum).<br><br>The book introduces techniques and approaches to original work so that anyone with an interest can usefully contribute to furthering our understanding and appreciation of these wonderful and important insects.</p><p>Oliver Prys-Jones studied zoology at the University of St. Andrews and furthered a long term interest in bumblebees and their life histories with doctoral and research fellowship studies at the University of Cambridge. He subsequently qualified in medicine at Liverpool University and remains absorbed by bumblebees while working as a medical practitioner in North Wales. Sarah Corbet has taught entomology and ecology in London University and the University of Cambridge. Her research interest is in pollination ecology, with a special focus on bumblebees.The Naturalist Handbook series started in 1983 with <em>Insects on Nettles</em> and my own collection goes up to number 27 <em>Insects on Cherry Trees</em> published in 1999. The first four were published by Cambridge University Press and the rest by Richmond Publishing Company. The title under review was first published in 1987 with a revised edition published in 1991. The new edition has revised and updated the text and reading list as well as including <em>Bombus hypnorum</em>, a species new to Britain in 2001. <em>Bombus cryptorum</em> has also been added to the list but <em>B. subterraneus </em>is now considered to be extinct. So the current British bumblebee fauna is now made up of 24 species (one less than the number recognized in the earlier edition), including the 6 parasitic &#x2018;cuckoo&#x2019; bumblebees which had previously been placed in a separate genus <em>Psithyrus</em> but are now considered as belonging to the genus <em>Bombus</em>.<br><br>The four plates of beautiful coloured illustrations by Anthony Hopkins have been retained and modified to reflect the small changes in the British list. A very welcome change is that the distribution maps have been increased in size and reproduced in colour, making them considerably easier to study.<br><br>The book starts with a useful introduction followed by a section on the distribution and recognition of species. There are about 250 species of bumblebees in the world, the majority of which occur in the North Temperate Zone. The authors discuss the significance and often damaging effects of introducing non-native species. The third chapter on the natural history of true bumblebees uses four of the commonest species to illustrate the range of natural history. It is only the queen that survives the winter and she general emerges from hibernation in spring. However, we have a winter-flowering honeysuckle in the garden outside our kitchen window and in December and January we have a very busy bumblebee foraging amongst the flowers. I look forward to studying her more closely and using the excellent keys to identify her!<br><br>Chapter 4 discusses the nesting habits of bumblebees and the possibility of establishing a captive colony. Chapter 5 deals with the cuckoo bumblebees, parasites, nest associates and predators. Chapter 6 discusses in great detail the foraging behaviour and invites individuals and groups to carry out detailed studies of the occurrence and behaviour of bumblebees. This is followed by a chapter on the threats, conservation and commercial use of bumblebees. Chapter 8 provides detailed advice and keys for the identification of bumblebees and is followed by a chapter on how to study these beautiful creatures. Chapter 10 provides a list of books and references for further reading amongst which is the superb volume 98 of the New Naturalist Library <em>Bumblebees</em> by Ted Benton, a beautifully illustrated and detailed account of these fascinating insects.<br><br>Finally the book is completed with a useful and concise index. This is a beautiful and interesting book which should appeal to the general naturalist as well as the specialist. (Maurice Moss <i>Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society</i>)<br><br>A long while ago there was one book on bumblebees. The original New Naturalist volume by Butler and Free. Then came the first Bumblebee Mapping Scheme and Bumblebees by David Alford, together with a flurry of interest in academic circles around the ideas of treating bumblebee colonies as model human societies, typified by Bumblebee Economics by Heinrich in the USA.<br><br>In the UK in the 1970s to 1990s a small group around Sarah (Sally) Corbet, based at Cambridge, produced a number of studies of bumblebee ecology, amongst which was one by Oliver Prys-Jones. This study, together with the background information needed by Prys-Jones to undertake his study (such as a key to bumblebee species), was based closely on the earlier key in Alford, and became the basis for one of the first volumes of ecological studies in The Cambridge Naturalist series.<br><br>This series aimed to promote the relatively new discipline of ecology to the wider public and, at the same time, to engage students with possible research topics. As such the first edition of Bumblebees never quite made it into the popular Natural History ratings, although lots of enthusiastic amateurs like myself bought it. I had already bought Alford with its great detail on bumblebee parasitology, but this was of fairly passing interest to one more interested in finding the aculeate Hymenoptera in the field than studies of the inner details of their parasites. I am afraid that I was similarly unimpressed by the descriptions of removing the honey stomach of a bumblebee in order to find the calorific value of its content, which, as I had got the key in its original form in Alford, was my overriding impression of the first edition of the Prys-Jones and Corbet volume. Quite apart from a certain reluctance to ascribe dubious human economic models to wildlife, I didn't have access to the calorimeters required to do such studies myself!<br><br>Since then much water has flowed under the bridge and bumblebees have again become a very popular group with the wider British public. Finding and naming bumblebees remains a major avenue of interest and there have been a variety of books and web-based resources servicing this need. Unfortunately, bumblebees are fairly readily recognised as such, but are much harder to name to species. Once one has become adjusted to the idea that accurate naming may well involve having a dead specimen with you and looking carefully at it with a hand-lens or microscope, the need for a taxonomic key becomes paramount.<br><br>Alford, expensive though it was, has long been out of print; let alone the rather cheaper reprint of the keys, provided to participants of the original Bumblebee Mapping Scheme (who has got my copy?): the original Cambridge Naturalist Volume, in both its editions, likewise. A very good key, revised from an earlier Essex-based volume, appeared in the very wide-ranging and readable new book on bumblebees in the New Naturalist series by Ted Benton. Like Alford, this volume was priced rather highly, but nevertheless sold out quickly; a victim of a publishing policy unfortunately predicated on a collectors' market, rather than the New Naturalist's first avowed aim of bringing serious natural history studies to the British public.<br><br>I was therefore very interested when Oliver and Sally approached the Bees, Wasps and Ants Rccording Socicty (BWARS) about using their data to provide up to date distribution maps for a new cdition. After some discussion it was decided to use new date classes for these printed maps, the old 1970 dividing line being somewhat irrelevant in 2010.<br><br>When my review copy dropped onto the mat it was not just the maps which gained my interest. The book was over twice the thickness of the original edition (my first edition copy also lost to some past student of bumblebees); clearly there was new material here.<br><br>On reading the book I found myself immediately engaged both by the content, a wide but not over-detailed, review of research which has gone on since the first edition, and the writing stylc; age and experience have served both authors well here. Yes, the energy studies are still there, but they are set within a much broader framework than originally. The key provides understanding of how to separate out the more tricky species and adds the new colonist Bombus hypnorum. It still requires a dead specimen for separation of the more awkward species but, as mentioned at the start, this is inevitable with this group of insects.<br><br>So, my verdict: once you have decided to get to grips with the more challenging species, and probably would like a bit more ecological meat, this is a very good and affordable introduction to the next stage. Get out and buy it!

Against the trend, one species, the striking <em>Bombus hypnorum</em>, has colonised England successfully and is now quite common.

As he trudged over the mist-slickened lane, his tired eyes rose to a bright full moon riding on a froth of night clouds. The light&#x2019;s reflection shimmered off the black Thames as it churned past the piers of London Bridge. A few windows of the shops and houses lining the bridge&#x2019;s span still glowed from candle flames, but most were dark. It was late. Sensible citizens were already abed. Crispin shivered. Pity he was no longer one of the &#x201c;sensible citizens.&#x201d;<br>He gripped his cloak tighter. Illness was miserable in any season, but this October night seemed particularly icy. He did not recall Octobers being as cold as this but perhaps the winds were changing. Summers were colder, winters longer. First it was plague and now this. Why was God so angry? Was not his anointed on the throne of England?<br>He coughed, trying to quiet it with his palm.<br>Crispin thought about the throne, about King Richard. Times had changed since the boy came to the throne and Crispin was cast from court. The king was nearing his majority. Soon he would be twenty-one and his handlers would have to step aside.<br>Crispin&#x2019;s boot slipped on the slimy paving. He swore and righted himself. Yes, Richard might still be a young man, but Crispin was nearing thirty-two and sometimes he felt far older. He&#x2019;d just finished a particularly rough job with a difficult client. It had been quite a puzzle finding that stolen necklace. Were all families so greedy and calculating, forging lies and deceptions behind masks of fawning compliments and false loyalties? He was glad to be orphaned, then, if that was what it meant to belong to a dynasty, even if it was a dynasty of wealthy grocers.<br>A half-smile formed on his chapped lips. It had been a good puzzle, though, and well-deserved coins clanked in the money pouch at his side. If he could avoid the Watch he could get home with a decent purse for a change. He hoped Jack had something warm on the fire, though he felt almost too weary to eat. Perhaps some warmed wine. That would fill the cold hollow in him.<br>The Shambles seemed farther than ever but he could not make his weary limbs hasten. Thirty-two. He couldn&#x2019;t be an old man yet! He had many good years ahead of him, surely. Look at Lancaster. He was ten years older than Crispin and there he was, off on a campaign to Spain. If Crispin still possessed his title, he would most likely have been on the road with Lancaster, one of the many thousands of valiant knights he had taken with him to the continent. Crispin would have been armed and ready for battle with the others, not weary and sick.<br>He stopped and turned toward the Thames, watching the lights from the bridge play on the rippling waters. Certainly he was just as fit as before, but how could that be true when exhaustion plagued him from so short a walk across Westminster to London? There had been a time when he had practiced with his sword all afternoon. Battles would go on for hours with few breaks. His muscles used to revel in the exertion.<br>Of course, that had been almost a decade ago&nbsp;... <br>&#x201c;God&#x2019;s blood,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;A <i>decade</i>? How can that be?&#x201d;<br>Nearly ten years since he picked up a sword in battle? Ten years? He supposed he was fit enough for a man whose limbs had forgotten how to balance a blade. Fit enough to recover the jewelry of vain women and protect the households of undeserving men.<br>He sneezed again and snuffled.<br>He should be the one at Lancaster&#x2019;s side in Spain. It <i>would</i> have been him if only&nbsp;... <br>No. No sense going down that deadly path in his thoughts. There was enough to worry over now. All of London feared the imminent threat of a French invasion and there was no lack of soldiers on the streets trying to keep order. Four months ago the king had declared that all London&#x2019;s citizens were to stockpile a three-month&#x2019;s supply of food, and prices had risen, fostering panic. King Richard and his minions were little better than street vendors when it came to controlling the populace. And where was Lancaster when you needed him? In Spain! Of all the foolish enterprises. Mustering all the chivalry of England to invade Spain while France watched and calculated, awaiting the moment to strike. How much more ransom did Lancaster need? How many more titles? For the first time, Crispin grumbled at his former mentor, perhaps begrudging too much the man&#x2019;s endless ambitions.<br>Disgusted, Crispin turned away from the placid Thames, determined to hurry home&nbsp;... and ran right into the Watch for his trouble.<br>The three men were just as surprised to come across Crispin as he was to find himself face-to-face with them.<br>The first man held aloft a burning cage of coals hanging from a staff. He stepped forward, showering light and embers on all their faces. &#x201c;The evening bell has been rung,&#x201d; he said. He was young, face barely flecked with traces of a blond beard. &#x201c;What are you doing abroad?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Harken,&#x201d; said his dark-haired companion, a poleax resting upon his shoulder. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know who this is?&#x201d;<br>Crispin waited, tensing. Three against one and they were far better armed. He was damned if he was going to give up any of his hard-earned coins for fines or bribes.<br>&#x201c;This here&#x2019;s the <i>Tracker</i>.&#x201d; He spit the word. &#x201c;Heard of him? He&#x2019;s the man the sheriffs are always nattering on about.&#x201d; Lazily, he switched the poleax to the other shoulder. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a man who <i>finds</i> things. Even finds criminals, they say. Brings them to the hangman.&#x201d;<br>The others looked at Crispin anew, eyes bright under their kettle helms. Crispin realized they were all quite young, perhaps only as old as the king. But it wasn&#x2019;t admiration in their gaze.<br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; said the one with the poleax. His grip tightened over the staff and he set the butt of it into the mud. &#x201c;&#x2018;Tracking&#x2019; tonight, are we?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; said the one with the light. &#x201c;What poor innocent have you swindled good coin from?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I assure you,&#x201d; Crispin answered with gritted teeth, &#x201c;that they were no innocents. And I do not swindle. I earn my coin with hard work. Not by harrying men on the streets.&#x201d;<br>The one with the poleax frowned. &#x201c;&#x2018;Harrying&#x2019; you? Are we harrying him, lads?&#x201d;<br>The one with the cresset grinned. The flames from the burning cage made his teeth gleam. &#x201c;Not yet, we haven&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s definitely breaking the law,&#x201d; said the other. &#x201c;All good citizens know well enough to be indoors after the bell and in such a time as this.&#x201d;<br>The third man, silent till now, drew his sword and pointed it in Crispin&#x2019;s direction. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s true enough.&#x201d;<br>Crispin&#x2019;s hand inched toward his dagger. &#x201c;Is this how London&#x2019;s Watch conducts itself? Like ruffians?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s up to no good,&#x201d; said the torchbearer. &#x201c;And I further think he needs to be taught a lesson for his sharp tongue.&#x201d;<br>The poleax lowered toward him. Crispin grabbed it and swung both man and ax into the torchbearer. He tumbled to the ground on all fours, gasping for breath. The flaming cresset rolled into a puddle and extinguished with a hissing cloud of smoke.<br>The long-haired swordsman made his move. Crispin swung toward him, hands closing over the blade as if it were a quarterstaff. As the surprised man tried to pull away, Crispin leaned back with all his weight, and curled into a roll. The swordsman was vaulted into the air as Crispin braced his feet against the man&#x2019;s chest and tossed him, sword and all, over his head. The guard landed behind him with a hard crunch and a groan.<br>The torchbearer recovered and staggered to his feet, proffering his sword. The only light now was from the moon. The blade gleamed then faded with the passing whim of a cloud. He and his poleax-wielding companion flanked Crispin on either side. Crispin let instinct guide him as the men slowly closed in. Each moved his weapon, trying to decide who should strike first.<br>Crispin glanced back. With the discarded sword too far away, the blade currently pointed at him would have to do.<br>The man began a chopping stroke toward Crispin&#x2019;s head, but Crispin ducked under the blade and elbowed the man&#x2019;s sword arm up, blocking the stroke. Using the curve of his shoulder to upend him, Crispin forcefully rolled him into the poleax man. Together, they tumbled to the ground in a heap, swearing and grunting.<br>Now there was time to scramble for the other discarded blade&nbsp;... but it was no longer discarded. The third man had recovered and with sword held high, advanced.<br>Crispin pulled his knife and caught the blade&#x2019;s downward descent with the cross guard of his dagger. With brute strength he forced the sword up and away.<br>Taken by surprise, the man left himself open. Crispin sneezed suddenly into his face and they both froze. Smiling apologetically, Crispin said, &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; and then punched his fist squarely into the man&#x2019;s nose.<br>Down he went just as the others behind him had gained their feet.<br><i>I&#x2019;m getting too old for this</i>. Crispin huffed a rattling breath and spun, clamping his armpit over the swordsman&#x2019;s arm. Using that leverage, he launched his leg outward and kicked the poleax man in the chest. He went down. By Crispin&#x2019;s reckoning, he would not be up again.<br>Still clutching the swordsman with one hand, Crispin&#x2019;s other fist found the man&#x2019;s face, and with a sickening crunch and a gush of blood, he knew that man, too, was down.<br>The other swordsman, spitting blood, uneasily climbed to his knees when Crispin swung out, delivering his boot to the man&#x2019;s head.

Considered &#34;the quintessence of Newbigin&#39;s thought&#34; by editor Eleanor Jackson, these papers record the dynamics of Newbigin&#39;s ideas about mission as he confronted new issues in the church and society. Newbigin&#39;s sermon at Riverside Church in New York City in 1960 opens discussion on the themes of unity in mission, changes in the missionary enterprise, and developments in the theology of mission. A second group of articles addresses specific &#34;frontline&#34; situations: mission in the modern city, the pastor&#39;s role in the inner city, and the future of the parish church. Newbigin then moves to frontier concerns: the resistance of modern society to the gospel, the cultural captivity of the church, and the consequences of witness in a world of religious and ideological pluralism - themes central to many of his full-length books. Finally, Newbigin sets the agenda for mission as the church approaches a new millennium. Spanning three significant decades in the history of church outreach, A Word in Season offers an important perspective on the course of Christian mission and provides valuable instruction to those who struggle with the missionary task today.Lesslie Newbigin is a minister in the United Reformed Church (UK) and a former bishop in the Church of South India.</p><h2>Tide</h2><p>An experiment in radiation treatment of fish produces mutations in the microscopic dino-flagellates the fish feed on.

Dust-to-Digital's marvelously titled <i>I Listen to the Wind That Obliterates My Traces</i> compiles music, photographs and literary excerpts that reflect on or present music itself as subject matter, from the earliest days of the phonograph. Culled from artist Steve Roden's collection of thousands of vernacular photographs related to music, sound and listening, the many gems to be found in this book (and its accompanying two CDs) include accounts of the Barnum-esque Professor McRea (&#x201c;Ontario's Musical Wonder&#x201d; ) and anonymous African-American guitar players, and an amazing trove of photographs of early phonographs. Other images range from professional portraits to accidental double exposures, via photographic formats such as tintypes, ambrotypes, cdvs, cabinet cards, real photo postcards and albumen prints. The two CDs bring together a variety of recordings, including one-off amateur recordings, regular commercial releases and early sound effects records. An array of contemporaneous quotations on music and early music technology from writers such as Knut Hamsun, Vladimir Nabokov and P�r Lagerkvist, as well as an essay by Steve Roden, bind the volume's conception into a unique meditation on recorded music's earliest consciousness of itself.</p><p>Steve Roden is a visual and sound artist living in Pasadena, California, his work includes painting, drawing, sculpture, film/video, and text. He has been exhibiting and performing his works in museums and arts spaces internationally since the mid 1980 s, including: Centre Georges Pompidou Paris, San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art, UCLA Hammer Museum Los Angeles, Museum of Contemporary Art Athens Greece, Serpentine Gallery London, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Walker Art Center Minneapolis, Singuhr-Horgalerie in Parochial, Berlin. Recently, the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena mounted a 20 year survey of Roden s visual and sound works, the exhibition was picked by the LA Times and ArtForum Magazine as one of the best of 2010. Roden has released over 20 solo recordings on various labels internationally, and has received numerous grants and awards, including a recently announced grant from the Foundation of Contemporary Arts in the Sound/Music category. Steve Roden has previously co-authored Krazy Kid s Food (2002), Taschen; and co-edited Site of Sound (1999), Smart Art Press. He has written numerous articles for various publications related to art, sound and design - such as: The Wire, Musicworks, Echoes, Open for Design as well as numerous exhibition catalogs. His text works have been published in various literary journals such as: Twenty Six, Errant Bodies, Drunken Boat and others. Some of his writing was included in the recently-published MIT Press anthology Sound as part of the Documents of Contemporary Art series.I listen to the wind feels like something altogether different, though, more like a silent movie, a collection crafted from crumbs of the past. Tucked within the simple, minimally designed book's front and back covers is the music, which Roden organized into a two-volume mix of similarly excavated documents culled from flea market 78 rpm discs. --Randall Roberts, Los Angeles Times Pop Music Critic July 31, 2011<br><br>A book of coffins; a book of openings to the sky. Americana but something more than that - a collection of aged photographs, brief literary texts and 51 recordings haunted by melancholy, not just the corrosive scour of time on photographic plate and shellac surface or scenes and distant art from another world; also a record of displacement and loss from times when ancestral memories hung close and poignant, each blemish on the surface of a photographic print a scar of war and poverty, great depression. dustbowl and epidemic, Steinbeckian passages of migration and loss, and all the while a ruthless thrusting of progress to liquefy the solid ground. --David Toop, Wire Magazine August 2011<br><br>The vintage photos inside this 184 page book are completely lovely... Pages and pages of interesting images to provoke curiosity and evoke reverie.

In a career that spans the second World War, Stevens is oblivious of the real life that goes on around him -- oblivious, for instance, of the fact that his aristocrat employer is a Nazi sympathizer. Still, there are even larger matters at stake in this heartbreaking, pitch-perfect novel -- namely, Stevens&#39; own ability to allow some bit of life-affirming love into his tightly repressed existence.A tragic, spiritual portrait of a perfect English butler and his reaction to his fading insular world in post-war England.

In examining independence festivals, children&#x2019;s games, annual almanacs, and the performances of itinerant puppet theaters, Beezley argues that these seemingly unrelated and commonplace occurrences&#x2014;not the far more self-conscious and organized efforts of politicians, teachers, and others&#x2014;created a far-reaching sense of a new nation.<br><br> In the century that followed Mexico&#x2019;s independence from Spain in 1821, Beezley maintains, sentiments of nationality were promulgated by people who were concerned not with the promotion of nationalism but with something far more immediate&#x2014;the need to earn a living. These peddlers, vendors, actors, artisans, writers, publishers, and puppeteers sought widespread popular appeal so that they could earn money. According to Beezley, they constantly refined their performances, as well as the symbols and images they employed, in order to secure larger revenues.<br><br> Gradually they discovered the stories, acts, and products that attracted the largest numbers of paying customers. As Beezley convincingly asserts, out of &#x201c;what sold to the masses&#x201d; a collective national identity slowly emerged. Mexican National Identity makes an important contribution to the growing body of literature that explores the influences of popular culture on issues of national identity. By looking at identity as it was fashioned &#x201c;in the streets,&#x201d; it opens new avenues for exploring identity formation more generally, not just in Mexico and Latin American countries but in every nation.<br><br> Check out the New Books in History Interview with Bill Beezley!</p><p>William H. Beezley established a reputation as one of the pioneer cultural historians of Mexico with the publication of his well-known book&nbsp;<i>Judas at the Jockey Club and Other Episodes of Porfirian Mexico.&nbsp;</i>His investigations into both Mexican and Latin American history have resulted in thirteen books, including the standard&nbsp;<i>Oxford History of Mexico,&nbsp;</i>edited with Michael C. Meyer. He and Judy Ewell focused on the lives of ordinary people in the past in their widely used text&nbsp;<i>The Human Tradition in Latin America,</i>&nbsp;which resulted in a series of books on the human tradition in other places and other times. Beezley is currently completing a concise history of Mexicans in the Revolution with Colin MacLachlan. Recently, his research has turned to wine in Latin America, and he has appeared as a guest on the Emmy Award-winning program&nbsp;<i>The Desert Speaks,&nbsp;</i>to discuss wine in Baja California del Norte and in Chile. He has begun a book on the Malbec varietal in the Americas. His Mexican investigations now focus on popular culture, especially sports and music of the 1950s. As professor history, he teaches at the University of Arizona. &nbsp;"Beezley has unearthed new sources and approached the entire study of nationalism in an innovative fashion.&nbsp;<i>Mexican National Identity </i>adds immensely to contemporary scholarship on nineteenth-century Latin America, not just Mexico."&#x2014;Linda Curcio-Nagy, author of&nbsp;<i>The Great Festivals of Colonial Mexico City: Performing Power and Identity&nbsp;</i><br><br> "Beezley's approach is unique, even daring. <i>Mexican National Identity&nbsp;</i>is organized, well written, deeply researched, and coherent.

While viewing a film about the building of the Great Pyramids of Egypt at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, Kevin is transported into King Khufu's burial chamber in the Great Pyramid as it is being built over 4,000 years ago. This book and tape introduce students to the building of the Great Pyramid through Kevin's eyes. Narration of this adventure and Kevin's thoughts are read by a male narrator whose voice resonates on the tape. Realistic sound effects add to the story as one hears the chiseling of the stones, voices at the pyramid, etc. Because the narrator does not follow the text exactly, this may be a confusing read-along. The historical facts, procedures, and vocabulary in the story are accurate. Kevin's thoughts are expressed in slang and shown in italics in the book. Included at the end of the book are a brief glossary and a few additional facts about the Great Pyramid. The book's watercolor illustrations produce a sense of being in there. Coloring throughout the book gives the impression of the sand and stone setting. As an introduction to how pyramids are built, this is an interesting tale.

Young Nonesuch, seeing his proud family wiped out by brutish humans during the Wars of the Roses, shrinks down to the size of a large insect to escape notice and sets out to learn more about people, and to find treasureas his grandmother always said, ``a dragon without a treasure is nothing but an ugly flying reptile.'' Something draws him to a gloriously-illustrated Book of Hours, and he accompanies it on its bumpy journey through the centuries. It comes to rest at last in the back room of a quiet bookstore on this side of the Atlantic, and Nonesuch guards it there still; a small, ferocious presence, seldom seen but comforting nonetheless. Plenty of lively characters help animate this rather leisurely story, from Lopped Cedric the one-legged bandit to the nameless rat who teaches Nonesuch to read and Abercrombie, the suave, ruthless real estate developer who learns that dragon justice is sudden and simple. Historiated initials and occasional small, sprightly drawings in the text and margins give the book a slightly antique look.

He forsakes his family treasure of goldthough his dragon nature demands that he guard somethingand finds treasure of his own: a Book of Hours lovingly illuminated by a monk during Nonesuch's youth near the end of the Middle Ages. He learns to read from a rat during the Black Plague. Centuries later, Nonesuch and his book are in the New World. How he becomes enmeshed in human affairs is at the center of Kushner's quiet, intelligent book.

Using psychobiographical analyses of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Wilhelm Reich, and Otto Rank as illustrations, the authors show how the central constructs of personality theories universalize their creators&#39; personal solutions to the nuclear crises and dilemmas of their own life histories. Illuminating the subjective origins of a personality theory does not invalidate the theory, according to Atwood and Stolorow, but rather contributes to establishing the scope of the theory as well as its applicability to particular clinical situations. The first edition of Faces in a Cloud (published in 1979) was the seminal work out of which emerged the now influential theory of intersubjectivity - a framework that calls for a radical revision of all aspects of psychoanalytic thought. This revised edition incorporates significant new material into the psychobiographical analyses and has been completely updated and rewritten to reflect the development of the authors&#39; viewpoint. The terminology used throughout the book to describe personal worlds of experience has been updated and refined in consonance with this contemporary theoretical perspective. The final chapter summarizes key aspects of this new perspective and offers reflections on the subjective origins of intersubjectivity theory itself.George E. Atwood, Ph.D., is a core faculty member at the Institute for the Psychoanalytic Study of Subjectivity, New York City, and professor of psychology at Rutgers University. Robert D. Stolorow, Ph.D., is a faculty member and training supervising analyst at the Institute of Contemporary Psychoanalysis, Los Angeles; a core faculty member at the Institute for the Psychoanalytic Study of Subjectivity; an dclinical professor of psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine.</p><h2>Leven Thumps And The Gateway To Foo</h2><p>When fate brings fourteen-year-old Leven and thirteen-year-old Winter together, they discover that for mankind to continue dreaming, the gateway between reality and dreams needs to be found and demolished.</p><p>What young readers are saying about this book: <p>"This book involves the magical place called Foo ...

And if there&#39;s one thing destined to bring a smile to faces the world over, it&#39;s The Inflatable Crown--as this one-of-a-kind, step-by-step guide to the most fabulous adornments ever to be put on a human head proves. Armed with a backpack full of balloons, a sturdy pump, a camera, and good intentions, balloon-twister Addi Somekh and photographer Charlie Eckert set out on an expedition that would take them to 34 countries around the world. Wherever they went, they brought joy and laughter, blowing, twisting, and turning balloons into tiaras, crowns, and Master Blasters. But readers of The Inflatable Crown don&#39;t need to travel any further than their own living rooms. This kit brings together 30 durable balloons, the best professional quality pump on the market, as well as a book filled with pictures from the authors&#39; adventures and clear instructions for 14 magnificent crowns. Whatever the age, The Inflatable Crown&#39;s perfect for parties, show-and-tell, and anywhere an element of fun is required.</p><p>When "certified balloonatic" Addi Somekh and his photographer friend, Charlie Eckert, got a bee in their bonnet to travel the world, spreading good cheer through... balloon hats, they had only a vague idea where this madness would lead. Three years and six incredible journeys later, the creative pair had brought smiles to the faces of thousands of people--and they had the makings of this book and balloon hat-making kit. The small, imaginative book describes Somekh and Eckert's experiences of showing up in towns and rural areas of Europe, Africa, Central America, the Balkans, Asia, the Middle East, and the United States, and making balloon hats for people in their natural, everyday environments. The bulk of the book, however, is a step-by-step pictorial guide to creating fantastic headpieces out of balloons. Numbered boxes with black backgrounds reveal crisp photos of hands twisting, pinching, and squeezing colorful balloons to create swirlies, ballies, dingies, teddy bear twists, loops, locks, and other cleverly named techniques that ultimately result in latex tiaras, polar bear loungers, unicorn hats, Martian helmets, and the spectacular Dysfunctionally Large Hat. Three international balloon photo galleries showcase gorgeous snapshots of people (and a camel or two) wearing or playing with Somekh's balloon creations.<p> Part sociological study, part entertainment, part how-to book, this kit, which includes the 152-page book, 30 colorful balloons, and a super piston-action pump (as well as a very convincing list of 7 reasons to make balloon hats), is pure fun. (Ages 8 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Addi Somekh is a balloon-twister who, with photographer Charlie Eckert, spent two years twisting balloon hats through 34 countries.

Invited to observe the centuries old ritual Ceremony of the Keys, she&#39;s spending the night (her first time away from her babies) since the complex is locked and guarded, and the high walls are surrounded by a disused moat. Having been given a tour of the Crown Jewels, interviewed and observed the Yeoman Warders, and met the Ravenmaster, Daisy has more than enough material for her article and decides to leave as early as possible the next morning to return to her family. But when walking down the stairs, she almost trips over the dead body of one of the Yeoman Warders. That there&#39;s something seriously amiss cannot be denied, due to the pike sticking out of his back. With her husband, Scotland Yard DCI Alec Fletcher assigned to resolve the case, Daisy once again finds</p><p>CAROLA DUNN is the author of a number of&nbsp;mysteries featuring Daisy Dalrymple. Born and raised in England, she lives in Eugene, Oregon.Chapter 1&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tower of London?&#x201d; Alec, spreading marmalade on his toast, spoke with a sort of deliberate casualness. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s rather a macabre subject to write about.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;One needn&#x2019;t go into the gruesome details,&#x201d; Daisy pointed out. &#x201c;More coffee? The Americans will love it. Just think, 1070 a.d. to 1925, eight and a half centuries of history! They can&#x2019;t match that even if they go back to Christopher Columbus.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;True.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mr. Thorwald says he&#x2019;s willing to buy a series of three or four articles about the Tower for Abroad magazine.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve already written to him?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;His answer just arrived.&#x201d; Daisy waved the telegram form from the top of the pile of letters by her plate. &#x201c;See how keen he is? He telegraphed rather than waiting for a letter to reach me. I got the idea when we took Belinda to see The Yeomen of the Guard at Christmas.&#x201d;<br>After a moment&#x2019;s silence while he swallowed a bite, Alec voiced the question Daisy was expecting.<br>&#x201c;What about the twins?&#x201d;<br>She had her response ready. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll only be gone for a few hours at a time, as I shan&#x2019;t have to go out of town. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s ideal. Honestly, darling, Nanny&#x2019;s perfectly competent. In fact, she&#x2019;s growing downright dictatorial. Since Mother went home to the Dower House&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And my mother retreated back to Bournemouth, thank heaven!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Exactly. Nanny no longer has their conflicting commands ringing in her ears. Isn&#x2019;t it odd how both of them insisted that no one on their side of the family ever had twins? As though there were something disgraceful about it,&#x201d; Daisy said indignantly.<br>&#x201c;Yes, I never thought to hear Lady Dalrymple and my mother agree on anything except that we shouldn&#x2019;t have married each other. But don&#x2019;t try to change the subject, Daisy.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Try! I thought I succeeded nicely.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Only briefly. Quite apart from leaving the babies with Nanny&#x2014;and I expect you&#x2019;re right about that&#x2014;are you sure you&#x2019;re recovered enough from the birth to go exploring the Tower? As I recall, it&#x2019;s nothing but stairs, stairs, and more stairs, most of them steep and narrow.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nearly the end of April already! They&#x2019;ll be two months old in a couple of days. I&#x2019;m perfectly all right, just going quietly mad stuck here in the house with nothing to do but give Oliver or Miranda a bottle now and then, when Nanny deigns to permit. It was fun when Belinda was at home. She so enjoyed helping with them during the Easter hols. But now she&#x2019;s gone back to school . . .&#x201d; Daisy sighed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad she&#x2019;s enjoying boarding school, but I do miss her.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So do I. Well, love, I&#x2019;m not about to come the heavy-handed Victorian paterfamilias&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better not try!&#x201d;<br>Alec grinned. &#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s exactly my feeling. But please don&#x2019;t traipse off if I have to go out of town, and make sure Nanny knows how to telephone me at the Yard.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She can always ring up and ask for me at the Tower.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I hardly think the Yeoman Warders will be willing to search that warren for&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, but that&#x2019;s the best thing. That is, not the best but what, added to G &amp; S, confirmed that I&#x2019;m positively meant to write about the Tower. Mrs. Tebbit and her daughter are living there now, in the King&#x2019;s House, and they&#x2019;ve invited me to lunch.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tebbit?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your mother&#x2019;s friend. At least, one of your mother&#x2019;s fellow bridge players. The divinely outspoken old lady.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;With the rather limp daughter? Living in the Tower? Not, I take it, imprisoned for high treason?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Darling, as though your mother would be acquainted with anyone who might be suspected of high treason!&#x201d; Daisy considered. &#x201c;Mrs. Tebbit might commit l�se-majest�, perhaps, but one can&#x2019;t be arrested for that nowadays, can one? Anyway, it seems the Resident Governor, Major General Carradine, is some sort of cousin, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tell me later, Daisy. I must be off.&#x201d; Alec gulped down the last drops of coffee, folded the News Chronicle and stuck it under his arm, and came around the table for a good-bye kiss. &#x201c;Things are slow at present, so I&#x2019;m hoping to clear up some arrears of paperwork before the Super has me arrested for dereliction of duty.&#x201d;<br>Daisy returned his kiss with verve before saying hopefully, &#x201c;Does that mean you&#x2019;ll be home early enough to take me out for some driving practice? With what Mr. Thorwald is going to pay me, I&#x2019;ll be able to buy a secondhand car!&#x201d;<br>Alec groaned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do my best. If you must have a car, it&#x2019;ll be just as well if you learn how to drive it without running over too many bobbies on point duty. We can&#x2019;t spare the men.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Beast!&#x201d; said Daisy, and pursed her lips for another kiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Daisy went up to the nursery. It had been Mrs. Fletcher&#x2019;s room while she lived with them, and Belinda had moved in when her grandmother moved to Bournemouth. Poor Bel had had to return to her tiny bedroom when the twins were born.<br>Not that the nursery was exactly large. In fact, it was definitely crowded with Nanny&#x2019;s bed and two cribs. A wardrobe, half occupied with shelves, stood against one wall. There was an armchair on one side of the fireplace and an elderly ottoman on the other, full of clean nappies. Its padded top was useful for changing wet and dirty ones. Later it could metamorphose into a toy chest. In the window was a small table with two rush-bottom chairs.<br>Remembering her own childhood, Daisy guessed that the rush seats wouldn&#x2019;t last long once the babies were up and about. Pulling bits out of them was irresistible.<br>Remembering her own childhood&#x2014;The trouble was that she couldn&#x2019;t help comparing this nursery with the spacious day-nursery, night-nursery, and schoolroom at Fairacres.<br>She had chosen to marry a middle-class policeman, chosen a life in a semi-detached house in the suburbs. She was content with her choice, but she had to admit to herself that she had never for a moment considered how it would affect her children.<br>Knocking softly on the door&#x2014;after all the nursery was also Nanny&#x2019;s bedroom&#x2014;Daisy thought ruefully that she had made her bed and the twins were going to have to lie in it.<br>Ah well, they didn&#x2019;t know anything different.<br>Nanny Gilpin opened the door with a finger to her lips. Her face was pink beneath iron-grey hair sternly pulled back under a starched cap. Her plum-coloured dress, mid-calf in length, had starched white collar and cuffs, and over it she wore a spotless starched white apron. In spite of all the starch, she was a kindly woman.<br>So, at least, said Daisy&#x2019;s friend Melanie Germond, who had recommended Mrs. Gilpin. Furthermore, her daughter, Bel&#x2019;s school-friend Lizzie, was still fond of her old nurse.<br>But Nanny Gilpin was undeniably old-fashioned. She expected absolute rule over the nursery, with parents admitted by appointment only. As she was, to all appearances, very good with the babies, Daisy was afraid of losing her and so catered to her whims, however reluctantly.<br>She had told Nanny she was going out to lunch and wanted to see the twins before she left.<br>&#x201c;You may come in, Mummy,&#x201d; Nanny whispered, &#x201c;but I just put them down for a nap, so not a sound, if you please.&#x201d;<br>Daisy tiptoed over to Oliver&#x2019;s crib. He lay on his back, eyes closed, arms spread wide, hands relaxed. The soft down on his head had a distinct gingerish tone. He might end up a redhead, like his elder sister, but Nanny said it would probably change as he grew older.<br>He looked so tiny, so delicate. The doctor said twins were always smaller than the average baby, which made sense. Otherwise, how enormous she&#x2019;d have been! They were both perfectly healthy though, thank heaven, and would catch up in height and weight in due course.<br>Oliver had kicked off his coverlet. Daisy leant forward to straighten it&#x2014;then pulled back at a warning cough from Mrs. Gilpin.<br>&#x201c;Now, Mummy, we don&#x2019;t want to wake him, do we?&#x201d;<br>Daisy swallowed a sigh. Of course Nanny knew best how to take care of babies, didn&#x2019;t she?<br>The baby&#x2019;s lips pursed in a sucking motion. One hand rose to insert a thumb in his mouth. It didn&#x2019;t mean he was hungry, she assured herself, as she had been assured.<br>Nanny moved forward in a purposeful way. Daisy hastily turned to Miranda&#x2019;s crib.<br>Miranda lay there quietly, good as gold, but her blue eyes were wide open. Catching sight of Daisy, she smiled. Daisy cast a quick glance behind her. Nanny was occupied with tucking in Oliver. Quick as a wink, Daisy scooped up her daughter in her arms for a quick kiss and cuddle before she was caught.<br>Miranda chuckled. Enchanted, Daisy kissed the top of her head, revelling in the softness of her dark fluff and sweet, milky smell.<br>&#x201c;Now, Mummy&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She was awake, Nanny. I didn&#x2019;t wake her, truly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And how is she ever going to fall asleep if you pick her up?&#x201d;<br>This was unanswerable. With an audible sigh, Daisy laid Miranda back in the crib, where she set up an earsplitting screech.<br>&#x201c;You see?&#x201d; asked Nanny accusingly.<br>Defeated, Daisy retreated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Melanie Germond had also been invited to lunch with the Tebbits. She called for Daisy and they walked together through an April shower to the tube station.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s so brave of you to carry a red umbrella,&#x201d; said Melanie with a touch of envy.<br>&#x201c;Brave?&#x201d; Daisy queried, surprised. After her craven surrender to Mrs. Gilpin, she felt anything but brave.<br>&#x201c;When practically everyone else&#x2019;s are black. People look at you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why shouldn&#x2019;t they? Anyway, they&#x2019;re only looking at the umbrella, really, not at me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I suppose it&#x2019;s your upbringing.&#x201d; Melanie sighed. &#x201c;We always had it drummed into us that one should never draw attention to oneself.&#x201d;<br>After living for a year and a half in St. John&#x2019;s Wood, Daisy was still discovering new facets of the difference between the middle classes and her own aristocratic background. She pondered. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we were ever taught anything so specific, certainly not that drawing attention to oneself is a virtue. I suppose it was sort of taken for granted that people would look at us, just because my father was Viscount Dalrymple. Unless we were among other people of the same sort, of course. Oh dear, that does make me sound stuck-up!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Daisy, that&#x2019;s not what I meant! No one could be less stuck-up than you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, I hope not. My brother had the umbrella made for me just before he went to France, to cheer me up. I think of it as a sort of outsize, year-round Armistice poppy.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, Daisy, I am sorry!&#x201d; Mel said miserably. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t seem to be able to help putting my foot in it today.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bosh! I didn&#x2019;t have to tell you that.&#x201d; She grinned. &#x201c;I could have just let you go on thinking me stuck-up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t. I never did. Do stop teasing, or I&#x2019;ll arrive with my face as red as your umbrella and everyone will stare at me.&#x201d;<br>Daisy gave her friend&#x2019;s face an envious glance. Mel had a perfect English rose complexion. Unlike Daisy, she had no need of powder to hide unwanted freckles. With just a touch of lip colour, and her unbobbed hair done up in a French pleat, she looked every inch the respectable bank manager&#x2019;s wife she was. Daisy was glad Alec had not followed his father into the banking profession. She could never have lived up to the requisite staidness. For one thing, a policeman&#x2019;s wife didn&#x2019;t have to entertain her husband&#x2019;s clients.<br>She suppressed a giggle. Alec&#x2019;s &#x201c;clients&#x201d; were crooks&#x2014;but Mel wouldn&#x2019;t understand her amusement. &#x201c;Not you, darling, you never blush, you lucky thing,&#x201d; she said, and folded her umbrella as they entered the shelter of the station.<br>&#x201c;If you were stuck-up,&#x201d; said Mel, &#x201c;you&#x2019;d travel by taxi, not by the Underground.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The tube is quicker than buses, and I&#x2019;m a working woman, remember. In fact, this is a working occasion for me. I&#x2019;m hoping to persuade the Resident Governor to give me special access for research. It would make for much more interesting articles than just parroting the guidebooks. Have you the right change for the ticket machine?&#x201d;<br>At Baker Street, they switched to the Inner Circle line, and a few rattling, swaying minutes later, they emerged from the Mark Lane station at the top of Tower Hill.<br>The shower had passed over. The sun shone in a sky decorated with little puffs of white lamb&#x2019;s wool. Daisy and Melanie paused to look down towards the river, where the ancient palace-fortress spread up the hill towards them, a breeze gently waving the Union Jack atop the White Tower.<br>&#x201c;It looks innocent as a picture postcard,&#x201d; Daisy remarked with a shudder.<br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Did you ever come here as a child? You&#x2019;re a Londoner; you must have.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I suppose most London children come, but I don&#x2019;t remember much about it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We were brought once as a treat. Gervaise loved it, of course, all the arms and armour and bloodshed. You know what ghouls little boys are. Violet saw it as romantic, besides being fascinated by the Crown Jewels. But I had nightmares for weeks afterwards. All that chopping off of heads: I got it mixed up in my mind with Alice in Wonderland. In my dreams, I confused the Red Queen with Bloody Mary, and Alice with Lady Jane Grey.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How horrible!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I even dreamt of ravens growing as tall as flamingos and turning into croquet hoops.&#x201d;<br>That made Mel laugh. &#x201c;I do remember being afraid of the ravens,&#x201d; she acknowledged.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been reading up on the history,&#x201d; said Daisy as they waited for the traffic policeman to let them cross to the gardens in the middle of Trinity Square. &#x201c;Gower&#x2019;s The Tower of London, to prepare for the articles.

The blare of motor horns and glint of sunlight on polished brass headlamps conjured up trumpet fanfares and cheering crowds. Absorbed by the view, Daisy didn&#x2019;t notice the constable on point duty waving them across the street.<br>&#x201c;Come on.&#x201d; Melanie tugged her arm. &#x201c;Do you know him?&#x201d; she asked as Daisy waved to the policeman.<br>&#x201c;Who? Oh, the bobby? No, but learning to drive has given me a new appreciation for their intrepidity.

The paintings and engravings discovered in African caves are amazing works of art that hold clues to understanding the history of humankind. Jean-Lo�c Le Quellec offers an expert analysis of this primitive art form, supplemented by photographs that capture the originality of prehistoric man's creativity. He divides Africa into four geographical zones: the Sahara, the Horn and East Africa, Southern Africa, and the west and central continent. Each zone is characterized by a unique artistic and representational style, ranging from realism to modern symbolism. The author places the artworks into the context of their discovery by the great explorers and evokes legendary tales to elucidate these enduring traces of prehistory.<br></p><p>Jean-Lo�c Le Quellec is an ethnologist, anthropologist, and specialist in prehistory and Saharan cave art who has published a dozen books on the subject.<br>Translator Paul Bahn is an expert on archaeology who has written, among other works, The Cambridge Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art, Archeology: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford Press, 2000).

It shows how the buildings of each historical period and culture are an expression of the spirit of their time, and how styles of architecture result from the materials that are available and the techniques that are understood. Representative buildings of each period are studied in fine, detailed illustrations: for example, Stonehenge, the Parthenon, the Colosseum, Chartres Cathedral, the Rialto Bridge, Versailles, the University of Virginia, the Crystal Palace, the Flatiron Building, the Sydney Opera House, and the converted Gare d'Orsay. The pyramids of Giza, Hindu temples in Khajuraho, the Badshahi mosque in Lahore, the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, a Japanese imperial villa, and the Chinese emperor's Forbidden City are the focus of chapters on the architecture of other cultures.</p></p><p>Grade 4-7-Milo attempts to introduce 8000 years of construction technologies, covering a multitude of continents and cultures. Although he does a good job of organizing the information and the book doesn't have a crowded appearance, it is difficult to cover so much ground in detail or depth. He explores important styles, periods, building materials, and purposes. This sets the book apart from Philip Wilkinson's Amazing Buildings (DK, 1993) and Mike Corbishley's The World of Architectural Wonders (Peter Bedrick, 1996), both of which offer a hodgepodge of interesting structures. Instead, this text is arranged somewhat chronologically, beginning with primitive wood shelters and ending with London's Millennium Dome. For each example, the author looks at the factors that influenced architecture and construction at that time. Many of the structures are those commonly examined, including Stonehenge, the pyramids, and the Roman Colosseum. Others, such as the Flatiron Building in New York City, the Crystal Palace, and the Palace at Versailles, are less frequently included in children's books. The full-color illustrations are competently done and are supplemented by small photographs, site plans, sketches, and maps. Occasional sidebars provide biographical information about an architect or historical background. While the book does include a detailed index of locations, names, terms, and materials, readers must search for buildings by city, so "Parthenon" is listed only under "Athens." If books on buildings are popular, this one will serve your collection needs.<br><i>Jeanette Larson, Texas State Library, Austin </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Pacific Northwest: An Interpretive History (Revised and Enlarged Edition)</h2><p>Carlos Arnaldo Schwantes has revised and expanded the entire work, which is still the most comprehensive and balanced history of the region.

He focuses on three major themes: economic development based on natural resources, the urbanization of society, and an increasing concern for the environment. The analysis is generally careful and the writing clear, but the chapters dealing with the 1890-1914 period are somewhat disjointed and contain some unsupported assertions, making it difficult to trace the course of Populism and Progressivism.

Only with the help of his faithful servant Mafoo and valiant flute-girl Voyaging moon, and only after a breathtakingly exciting string of adventures, can Jen discover the real meaning of the gifts and face his true destiny.</p><p>Born on January 30, 1924, in Philadelphia, storyteller <b>Lloyd Alexander</b> spent his childhood filling his imagination with fantasies about other lands and eras. For ten years of his writing career, Alexander wrote for adults, then changed gears and wrote fiction for young people. Alexander has received a Newbery Medal, a Newbery Honor Award, a National Book Award, and several IRA-CBC Children&#x2019;s Choice Awards. He is also the author of many ALA Notable Children&#x2019;s Books and School Library Journal Best Books of the Year.Grade 5-10-- From deep in the cauldron of world story comes a rich fantasy about a young man's journey from innocence to experience. In China during the Tang Dynasty, young Prince Jen, heir to the Dragon Throne, sets off to find T'ien-kuo, or Heavenly Kingdom, the utopia described by a mysterious wandering scholar. Accompanied by a large retinue of soldiers and his practical, plain-spoken servant, the idealistic, sheltered prince bears six gifts for the ruler of T'ien-kuo. As his journey progresses, he loses everything: his retinue, his possessions, his identity, his illusions, his friends, until at last, in one of Alexander's most moving passages, he finds himself a common criminal, wandering the roads of his own kingdom, wearing the wooden collar of punishment. Although experience is a harsh teacher, Jen never loses his common humanity, nor his faith in the bondmaid he loves. Alexander borrows form and content from the popular novels of the Ming and Ch'ing Dynasties, particularly Shi Nai'an's Outlaws of the Marsh (China Bks., 1988), and is influenced, as are the Ming-Ch'ing novels, by the vernacular literature of the Sung Dynasty. Yet Jen's story transcends all boundaries, mixing Alexander's familiar cast--the impulsive, good-hearted boy; the clever, independent young woman; the assortment of eccentric, loyal companions--with flavors of European folklore; Hans Christian Andersen; admiring Chinoiserie, Buddhist and Taoist ideas; Arabian Nights extravagance. Alexander satisfies the taste for excitement, but his vivid characters and the food for thought he offers will nourish long after the last page is turned. --Margaret A.

LC 96-72053This set of scholarly essays is for those interested in the multivalent esperanto of modernist Mina Loy. The unflinching scholar Elisabeth Frost; Loy biographer Carolyn Burke (Becoming Modern, LJ 2/1/96); and Roger Conover, editor of a recent edition of Loy poetry, are among the many contributors who weigh in here to honor the strange and difficult metaphysical inquiry of the poet. Loy's overwriting is explored as a means of "scrutinizing the social and literary marginalization of women," and her work is examined in terms of the emerging modernist techniques of fracture and cubism. Her refusal to approach lyricism as reparation or compensation is viewed here as deliberate discontinuity. Writing such as Loy's allows for a wide variety of scholarly maneuvering, and this volume, with a massive 100-page bibliography, successfully attempts some elucidation of a difficult realm.?Scott Hightower, NYU/Gallatin, New York<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Into the Stillness: Dialogues on Awakening Beyond Thought</h2><p><p><b>At once extraordinarily wide-ranging and sharply focused, <i>Into the Stillness</i> offers several deceptively simple and informal conversations about life, existence, and identity in one book.</b></p><p>This is an important book.

As the leader of the Lewis and Clark expedition, an epic exploration of uncharted territory west of the Mississippi, Lewis has been the subject of several biographies, yet much of the published information is unreliable. A number of myths surrounding his life and death persist.Now independent scholars Thomas C. Danisi and John C. Jackson have written this definitive biography based on twelve years of meticulous research. They have re-examined the original Lewis and Clark documents and searched through obscure and overlooked sources to reveal a wealth of fascinating new information on the enigmatic character and life of Meriwether Lewis.Instead of focusing on the Lewis and Clark expedition, the authors concentrate on what Lewis was doing immediately before and after the journey through Western territory. They assess his role as a natural scientist and as governor of the Louisiana Territory. His lifelong mentor, Thomas Jefferson, thrust the latter role upon Lewis during a time of crisis. As Danisi and Jackson reveal, he would much rather have devoted this time compiling his notes and scientific findings into a vivid narrative of the expedition&#39;s adventures.Finally, using medical documentation, the book reveals the actual cause of Lewis&#39;s untimely death. The authors address both the conspiracy theories regarding murder as the cause of Lewis&#39;s death and the longstanding belief that he committed suicide.The Meriwether Lewis that emerges from this thoroughly researched biography is a man of honorable intentions who met severe challenges and handled difficult confrontations with patience and diplomacy. Both professional historians and armchair devotees of American history will want to add this important new work to their libraries.</p><p>Thomas C. Danisi (St. Louis, MO) and John C. Jackson (Olympia, WA) are freelance writers and historians. In 2004, they received a grant from the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation to research this book. Danisi is the author of Uncovering the Truth about Meriwether Lewis and numerous articles on the history surrounding Meri�wether Lewis and the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Jackson is the author of four books on the history of the Pacific Northwest, including By Honor and Right: How One Man Boldly Defined the Destiny of a Nation.Independent historians Danisi and Jackson offer a meticulously researched, if occasionally obsessive, account of Meriwether Lewis's life, focused primarily on the tragically short years after the famous Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804&#x2013;1806. The authors propose the novel but credible theory that Lewis's mysterious 1809 death, generally considered a suicide, was a result of unwitting self-poisoning with mercury treatments for his recurring, debilitating bouts of malaria. In the process, the authors also effectively debunk conspiracy theorists' suggestions that Lewis was murdered. After the expedition, Lewis served as governor of the Louisiana territory, was embroiled in the convoluted and harsh politics of the territory and worked sedulously on Indian affairs. Although Danisi and Jackson's choice to focus on Lewis's post-1806 life is understandable given the numerous expedition histories, Lewis's last years will be less compelling to many readers than his iconic journey across the American continent. In the end, regardless of how well researched and insightful, this work is likely to be appreciated almost exclusively by professional historians and Lewis and Clark enthusiasts. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Arranged in roughly chronological order, it brings together movie posters from around the world, starting with Charlie Chaplin film ads and the Russian Revolutionary movie posters of the 1910s, then spanning the century to show posters publicizing hits of the 1990s, including <i>The Silence of the Lambs, </i> Spike Lee films, and many more. The book�s sections focus on renowned individual designers, directors, movies, and genres. Important poster designers such as Saul Bass, Jan Lenica, and Juan Gatti receive particular attention, as do great directors who had strong opinions about how their films should be represented. Among the latter are Alfred Hitchcock, Jean-Luc Godard, and Otto Preminger. All major film genres are represented�musicals, Kung Fu movies, <i>films noir, </i> westerns (including so-called �spaghetti westerns� filmed in Italy), science fiction classics, and others. Readers are treated to examples of movie posters not only from the United States, Britain, and France, but also to previously unpublished examples from countries as diverse as Poland, China, and Cuba. For instance, fans of Orson Welles might be surprised to see the previously unpublished Italian poster advertising <i>Citizen Kane</i> under its Italian title, <i>Quarto Potere (The Fourth Estate). </i> This handsome volume will be valued by graphic designers, poster collectors, and anyone sharing the popular passion for cinema.</p><p>Emily King is a lecturer and writer specializing in twentieth-century graphic arts. She is currently visiting lecturer at the Royal College of Art, London, and design editor for <i>Frieze</i> magazine, a British publication.The film noir revival is still booming, so Eddie Muller's glossy <i>Art of Noir</i> [BKL D 15 02] won't immediately yield to this far more comprehensive poster survey in movie buffs' hearts. Graphic design specialist King's album isn't to be sniffed at, though. She presents hundreds of posters essentially chronologically in four chapters: "The Birth of Cinema," "The Rise and Fall of the Studios," "New Wave and Blockbusters," and "The Dawn of the Multiplex." If those titles seem to emphasize commercialism, well, this is advertising art, Bunkie! Each chapter contains, after a brief sketch of relevant film-industry history, two- to four-page subchapters grouping posters by style, director, studio, actor, nationality, or, rarely, poster artist. The color throughout seems true to the source posters, a few of which are faded. King's commentary is always intelligent (if, a few times, factually awry), though movie buffs may differ with her about how well certain posters express their movies' themes. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Over the next two-and-a-half years, he recorded, in clear and simple prose, just about everything he did and everyone he saw. Although carefully preserved, the journal was later suppressed by the town historian, presumably because he found some of the entries morally objectionable. Rediscovered by Amelia F. Miller, and coedited by Miller and A. R. Riggs, this document now appears in print for the first time, accompanied by related letters of Ashley's extended family as well as brief biographies of more than 750 people mentioned by the young doctor in his writings.<br><br>With flashes of humor and close attention to detail, Ashley describes a broad range of activities and experiences in the small village of Deerfield and the surrounding towns of the Connecticut River valley. Articulate as well as observant, this former schoolteacher conveys a sense of immediacy that brings even the most mundane daily events to life. He discusses medical theory and practice, revolutionary politics, farming, his family, his circle of friends, and amusements ranging from singing and dancing to sleigh riding and bouts of drunkenness. He also writes about his love life, including a dalliance with the older sister of his fiancee, Polly Williams, while the latter is away visiting relatives in the Berkshires.<br><br>For Ashley, personal relationships and politics were the prominent issues of 1773 and 1774, as events in Massachusetts drew the province toward rebellion. He discusses the gathering of angry mobs in response to the so-called Intolerable Acts, the stoppage of the courts in Hampshire County, the anarchy that ensued, and the persecution of loyalists, with or without the sanction of law. When the revolution breaks out in April 1775, he describes the departure of companies of minutemen as they set out for Boston to challenge the British Army. <br><br>Six months later, in November 1775, the journal abruptly ends. By then, however, Elihu Ashley had already bequeathed to posterity an extraordinary firsthand account of life in rural New England in the years immediately preceding the War of Independence.</p><p>"This book provides the reader with that rare and wonderful thing-a window on the lives of ordinary people in a time of high historical significance. Vivid, entertaining, and moving, it chronicles the coming to manhood of a high-spirited young New Englander bound for the medical profession on the eve of the American Revolution. . . . Richly detailed and superbly edited, Romance, Remedies, and Revolution is both an important addition to the historical literature of the period and a delight to read."--Robert F. Dalzell Jr., author of "Enterprising Elite: The Boston Associates and the World They Made" <p>"An important, largely unutilitzed source for studying eighteenth-century social life and the coming of the American Revolution. Even more notable is the fact that the journal can stand on its own as a piece of literature: it's readable and entertaining and it has an implicit plot line tracing Elihu's ultimately successful though often rockey courtship of Polly Williams. It has something of the flavor of both Samuel Pepys's diary and an eighteenth-century English novel."--Kevin M.

Many in their Plymouth colony won't make it through the winter, and the colony's first harvest is possible only with the help of two friends, Samoset and Squanto.<p>Richly detailed paintings show how the pilgrims lived after landing at Plymouth, through the dark winter and into the busy days of spring, summer, and fall. Culminating with the excitement of the original Thanksgiving feast, "Three Young Pilgrims" makes history come alive.</p></p><p>Cheryl Harness lives in Independence, Missouri. As an author and illustrator, she is known for her engaging approach to history, seen in such books as <i>Our Colonial Year</i>; <i>Mary Walker Wears the Pants</i>;<i> Young Abe Lincoln</i>;<i> George Washington</i>;<i> Spymaster</i>; <i>Three Young Pilgrims, Ghosts of the White House</i>; and <i>Remember the Ladies.</i>Using the lives of three real children who traveled on the Mayflower and lived in the Plymouth Colony--Mary, Remember and Bartholomew Allerton--Harness focuses on their experiences and "adventures during one year, between the autumns of 1620 and 1621." She surrounds their story with the larger one of the Pilgrims' struggle for religious freedom and human survival, and invests these figures from the past with a vitality and accessibility that transcend the customary seasonal emphases. This is no sanitized interpretation: the death of the children's mother and her new baby is included, as are the illnesses and deaths of many of the other "Saints"--Pilgrims--and "strangers"--non-religious members of the settlement party. Nor is the historical information here confined to the well-paced, involving text; equally effective are the carefully researched watercolor, gouache and colored pencil paintings--possessed of a suitable rusticity, they expand the narrative with dramatic intensity. A generous inclusion of diagrams, charts and maps abounds with the kind of details and labels capable of mesmerizing youngsters for hours. This notable blend of fact and fiction deserves year-round popularity.

Gibraltar has a complex and varied military history, lying as it does at the gateway to the Mediterranean and the meeting points of the continents of Europe and Africa. Its history, always shaped by its unique combination of strategic position and topography, begins in ancient times with successive occupations by Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Romans. It then passed through Arab, Castilian and Spanish hands, and has been a British possession since 1704. The Rock served as a base for Nelson's fleet in the Napoleonic Wars and, in World War II, for the Royal Navy's Task Force 'H' and as as a vital stopping place for supply convoys plying to and from the East through the Suez Canal and supporting the Allied effort in the Mediterranean Theater. An unprecedented amount of tunnelling took place on Gibraltar, making it a veritable warren that housed aircraft hangars, ammunition stores, hospitals and even a secret chamber (the Stay-Behind Cave) that was to be manned as an observation post in the event of a hostile takeover.</p></p><p><p>Darren Fa was born in Gibraltar 1966.

Educated at Gibraltar Grammar School, he completed a BSc at the University of Liverpool, UK, and went on to obtain a DPhil from the University of Oxford. A former managing director of the Gibraltar Tourism Agency, in 1991 Clive became Director of the Gibraltar Museum. The author lives in Gibraltar.</p><p>&#x201c;This volume will prove fascinating, not only for the CDSG members who recently visited Gibraltar, but for anyone interested in the history of fortifications. Finlayson and Fa, director and deputy director of the Gibraltar Museum respectively, are more than qualified to tell the long and involved story of the defense of Gibraltar, and they have illustrated it with many well-chosen paintings, maps, plans, and photos...

This book integrates the spiritual practice of mindfulness with psychological techniques for changing negative thoughts and behaviors into a powerful and proven-effective program for coping with this serious and distressing condition.</p> <p>Current statistics suggest that as many as 17 million Americans suffer from depression; further research states that less than 25 percent of these receive adequate treatment for the disorder. In clinical trials, treatment approaches that incorporate spirituality with psychology have proven to be dramatically effective at countering depression. This book is co-written by a leading specialist in the treatment of depression and a clinical nurse who, as a Zen practitioner trained with Charlotte Joko Beck and Jon Kabat-Zinn.</p> <p>A concept grounded in the practice of certain forms of Buddhism, mindfulness is the conscious, uninvolved awareness of the present moment. Western psychologists have recently learned that this state of mind is particularly conducive to the accomplishment of cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT: an active mode of psychological treatment that attempts to recognize and counter negative thoughts and behaviors before they lead to debilitating symptoms like depression. As statistics confirm again and again that depression is the single most common psychological problem affecting Americans, the refinement of psychotherapy through the integration of spirituality-based techniques has generated considerable interest among psychology professionals. This approachable and easy-to-use book makes these powerful techniques available to the general public.</p> <p>The book is built around a compelling series of specific, step-by-step interventions that provide readers with an understanding of the thoughts that lead to depression. They learn how to find the motivation to confront depressive feelings. By sitting with painful emotions and allowing them to pass, you will find that you can reduce the frequency of depressive episodes. Using meditation practices for observation and awareness, develop the ability to recognize cognitive, physiological, and environmental triggers that can lead to aggravated periods of the disorder. When you change how you approach your day-to-day life, your daily activities, the choices you make, and the way you cope with life's ups and downs you strengthen the skills you need to move beyond depression and develop lasting peace of mind.</p></p><p>"A life shaken by depression is also a life open to the possibility of deep transformation," write John McQuaid, Ph.D., and Paula Carmona, R.N., M.S.N., experts in treating depression. They recommend a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and meditation. CBT teaches you to track your thoughts, observe behaviors, and notice how these affect depression. By changing thoughts and behaviors, you learn to change your emotions and mood. Meditation trains you to observe your life and thoughts. Both can help you identify, then change, core beliefs that influence depression, resulting in new core beliefs based on your values. <i>Peaceful Mind</i> doesn't have the snappy sentences, pep talks, or quick-read paragraphs common to self-help books. The style is calm, the content detailed, much as a therapist might explain things to you. Sometimes the style seems gloomy (e.g. "feeling desiccated, like a dried bag of bones"), but the overall feeling is optimistic. The authors hold out hope and contentment, and a conviction that this can help you get there. Psychologist John R.

As the flame of revolution ignites in a country where the rich have always ruled, Katya's once-certain future dissolves.<p></p>National Book Award-winning author Gloria Whelan transports readers to a crumbling, war-torn Russia, where one young woman, growing up in the shadow of a revolution, must take her future into her own hands.<p></p></p><p>From the author of the 2000 National Book Award winner, <i>Homeless Bird</i>, comes an evocative glimpse into a chilling period in world history. Gloria Whelan manages to take the fly-on-the-wall approach one step further in her latest piece of historical fiction. In <i>Angel on the Square</i>, a young girl joins Russian Tsar Nikolai II, Empress Alexandra, and their children when her mother becomes one of the empress's ladies-in-waiting. Katya Ivanova, as companion to the Romanov children, has an insider's view of the crumbling of tsarist Russia from 1913 to 1918. Initially, life is lavish and amusing for this young aristocrat, although her friend Misha's revolutionary ideas often battle in her mind with her own loyalty to the tsar. Gradually, though, the world outside begins to enter the palace walls, and Katya's life--along with that of all nobility--changes forever.<p> Whelan's balanced treatment of both sides of the Russian revolution is remarkably accessible. Katya is an appealing protagonist; readers will hang on her every word as she is transformed from a spoiled, sheltered child into a caring, hard-working adult. Young readers couldn't ask for a better introduction to this terrifying, earthshaking epoch in history.

Called by some "practical philosophy," by others "templates in straight thinking" &#x2013; these works represent centuries of Sufi thought aimed at the development of human potential to its fullest extent. They stress virtues such as common sense, clear-thinking and humor to counter cant and religious dogma. As such they may be viewed as an antidote to radicalism and fanaticism much needed in the world today. Hoopoe Books publishes stories in this tradition selected for children: "From thinking children come thinking adults."<p>Fatima The Spinner And The Tent is based on a classical "Teaching-Story" well known in Greek folklore - this particular version is attributed to Sheikh Mohamed Jamaludin of Adrianople (modern-day Edirne). Fatima the Spinner and the Tent is the tale of a woman who seems beset with one disaster after another as she travels from Morocco to the Mediterranean, Egypt, Turkey, and finally China. It is in China that she realizes the that what seemed to be terrible misfortune was in fact a valuable part of her life and her path to fulfillment, for in the course of her journey she learned the skills that would serve her well in her hour of greatest need. A story of wisdom and hidden depth, recommended for bedtime reading and children's library collections. -- Midwest Book Review When a shipwreck leaves her washed up on a beach, Fatima is taken in by a family of weavers. She learns their trade, only to be captured by slavers, who sell her to a mast-builder. Entrusted to accompany a cargo to market, the girl survives another shipwreck off the coast of China, where she is welcomed by townspeople as the female stranger of legend who would make a tent for the Emperor. She is delivered to the palace, where she uses her skills to complete the task by spinning flax into ropes; weaving some sturdy cloth; and carving tent poles, finally realizing her wish for happiness. The story fulfills the requisites of a folktale-a strong main character, three misfortunes, the completion of a seemingly impossible task, and the granting of a wish. Delmar's finely detailed paintings incorporate a variety of Middle Eastern and Chinese designs, both within the pictures and in borders surrounding text boxes. Several spreads are panoramas that have amazing depth. An endpaper map shows the path of Fatima's travels. Although some aspects of the plot are weaker than the protagonist's strength of character, children will relate to the positive lesson about making the best of one's misfortunes. -- School Library Journal</p></p><h2>The Light Of The World (Thorndike Press large print biographies and memoirs)</h2><p>The acclaimed poet reflects with gratitude on her life after the sudden death of her husband, discussing her personal quest for meaning and understanding, her renewed devotion to her teenage sons, and meditating on the blessings of love and family.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of April 2015:</strong> Elizabeth Alexander&#x2019;s memoir of her marriage and the sudden death of her husband is by turns sorrowful and joyful, earthy and elegiac, deeply personal and achingly universal. Alexander, an acclaimed poet perhaps best known for the poem she delivered at Barack Obama&#x2019;s first inauguration, is a professor at Yale. (In an aside, she reveals that she is only the 3rd African American woman to get tenure at that University.) Her husband, Ficre, was an Eritrean who&#x2019;d survived civil war in Africa to become a chef and artist in America; their marriage, as chronicled here, was a triumph of politics, society and romance. It was not without its secrets or its difficulties, but it was clearly a happy, no, make that a joyful union; the pleasures of cooking together (Alexander sometimes includes recipes), entertaining a huge, international group of family and friends and raising their two precocious boys is palpable on every mellifluous page. Like Joan Didion, Meghan O&#x2019;Rourke and Roger Rosenblatt before her, Alexander here faces the unfaceable topic of loss -- and almost convinces us &#x2013; and herself &#x2013; that despite her terrible grief, she is grateful for the life and love that preceded it. --<em>Sara Nelson </em></p>Elizabeth Alexander composed and recited "Praise Song for the Day" for President Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration.

Schaller&#39;s photos and essays introduce the majestic landscape, extraordinary wildlife, and traditional nomadic society of this remote region. He concludes with a plan that would allow the people and animals there to continue to live in harmony.

Includes recipes.</p><p>Grade 3-6-Eight or nine recipes are interspersed throughout these informative texts. All include full-page period photographs and illustrations. In Nineteenth-Century Whaling Ships, the first meal is cabbage and Irish potatoes, because it calls for what would be the freshest ingredients on board. Not to worry: no recipes call for whale blubber or oil. Most tend toward the complicated and adult help will be needed (and appreciated). Phrase origins for the likes of "slush fund" (money paid for leftover grease in whaler speak) and "skid row" (initially skid road in logging parlance) are included. Students might find it interesting to compare the information in these titles. For example, while the whaling ship's cooks were among the lowest ranked on board, the lumber camp's cook was the most important crew member, after the foreman. These books are just as tempting, perhaps more so, for their historical ingredients as for the recipes.

Two of Mick&#39;s henchmen have been killed during a raid on one of his bourbon warehouses and Mick wants Scudder on the case, but someone else wants Scudder off the job.</p><p>You would think that by the 14th novel in a series, an author might become a bit bored with his characters, a bit sloppy in his writing. Thankfully, Lawrence Block is no such writer. Matt Scudder, in his 14th appearance, is as sharp and entertaining as he is in such mysteries as <i>Eight Million Ways to Die</i> and <i>A Dance at the Slaughterhouse</i>. Scudder is one of the few dicks out there with a fully fleshed-out personality; he's not insensitive to the mayhem around him, and his fears are well founded and realistic. After all, as the title boldly states, we live in a world where everybody dies.<p> Settled into married life, sober, and finally a legit private eye (the state granted his license), Scudder is prepared to become a respectable high-priced detective working for New York City lawyers. But when his old buddy, Mick Ballou, comes to him because two of his runners end up murdered, Scudder finds himself sinking back into the muck of the underworld. While dodging thugs who are out to put a stop to his investigation, Scudder must figure out who has it in for Ballou.</p><p> The writing in this novel is elegant--equally supple in describing the gibbous moon as it is in sorting out Scudder's feelings on the murder of a close friend, or when recounting a rather gory eye plucking. The dialogue is snappy and true to life. Lawrence Block once again proves he's worthy of the title Grand Master of Mystery. So be sure to set aside a chunk of time before you sit down to read this novel, because you're not going to be able to tear yourself away. <i>--Jenny Brown</i></p>Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.

He's living in a world where the past is a minefield, the present is a war zone, and the future's an open question. It's a world where nothing is certain and nobody's safe, a random universe where no one's survival can be taken for granted. Not even his own.</p><p>A world where everybody dies.</p></p><h2>Indivisible by Two: Lives of Extraordinary Twins</h2><p><p> A leading expert on twins delves into the stories behind her research to reveal the profound joys and real-life traumas of twelve remarkable sets of twins, triplets, and quadruplets. </p><p> <i>Indivisible by Two</i> introduces us to an assortment of memorable characters, from the "Fireman Twins"--brothers who, though reared separately, are astonishingly similar in personality and behavioral traits--to the twin sisters who overcame one twin's infertility by having the other serve as her surrogate mother. We meet one of the few identical brother-sister pairs in the world after one of two sisters was surgically transformed into a man, and identical triplet brothers, only one of whom is gay while the others are straight. We see uniquely blended families--identical twin brothers marrying identical twin sisters, and Chinese twins adopted by different Canadian families yet raised as sisters. </p><p> Being a twin can also render the experience of historical tragedy uniquely painful. We meet Stepha and Annetta, survivors of Josef Mengele's heinous experiments in Auschwitz, and untangle the troubled lifelong tie between Jack and Oskar, born in the 1930s to a Jewish father and a German Gentile mother, one raised as a Jew in Trinidad and the other as a Catholic and a member of the Hitler Youth in Nazi Germany. </p><p> Segal unravels these stories and others with an eye for the challenges that life as a twin (or triplet or quadruplet) can pose to parents, friends, and spouses, as well as the twins themselves. These moving stories remind us how incompletely any theory explains real life--twin or not. </p></p><p>Nancy L.

Raised from infancy by their grandmaster, they think of their temple as their home and their fellow warrior monks&#x2014;their &#x201c;temple brothers&#x201d;&#x2014;as their family. Then one terrible night, the temple is destroyed. Fu and his brothers are the only survivors. Charged by their grandmaster to uncover the secrets of their past, the five flee into the countryside and go their separate ways. Book #1 follows Fu as he struggles to find out more and prove himself in the process.</p><p>Jeff Stone practices the martial arts daily. He has worked as a photographer, an editor, a maintenance man, a technical writer, a ballroom dance instructor, a concert promoter, and a marketing director for companies that design schools, libraries, and skateboard parks. Like the heroes of The Five Ancestors series, Mr. Stone was adopted when he was an infant. He began searching for his birthmother when he was 18; he found her 15 years later.

I feel like a pickled vegetable.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shhh!&#x201d; warned his brother Malao, lying directly on top of him. &#x201c;Grandmaster told us to remain perfectly quiet, and perfectly still.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I <i>know</i> what Grandmaster said,&#x201d; Fu replied. &#x201c;But we can&#x2019;t stay crammed in here forever. I say we get out right now. I say we stop hiding and fight!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Calm yourself, Fu,&#x201d; whispered his brother Seh from on top of Malao. &#x201c;We are all just as cramped and uncomfortable as you are. But we must do as Grandmaster said and remain silent and hidden. The enemy within our walls is unlike any faced by Cangzhen Temple in more than a thousand years.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah,&#x201d; Fu said. &#x201c;Stop being so dramatic. You guys are sounding more and more like Grandmaster every day. I don&#x2019;t care who&#x2019;s out there. We&#x2019;re all masters now. We&#x2019;ve all passed the tests.

We should be&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hush!&#x201d; snapped Fu&#x2019;s brother Hok, who was lying on top of Seh. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough, Fu! You&#x2019;re making even <i>me</i> angry now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care!&#x201d; Fu replied. &#x201c;If you think&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quiet!&#x201d; hissed Fu&#x2019;s oldest brother, Long, from the top of the pile. &#x201c;Control your tongues, all of you! Brother Fu, empty the words from your mouth and then empty your mind. You must take control of your thoughts and your emotions, or they will control you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>You must take control of your thoughts and your emotions, or they will control you</i>,&#x201d; Fu mocked. &#x201c;Give me a break, Long. Right now we need action, not philosophy.&#x201d;<br><br>Fu was quickly losing his patience. He could hear enemy horses racing up and down the brick pathways that crisscrossed the temple grounds. He also heard weapons clashing and men crying out&#x2014;plus a terrible, new sound. It was almost like thunder, except every boom was followed by a pain-filled scream. Fu&#x2019;s keen ears recognized each and every scream. Warrior monks were falling.<br><br>A low growl resonated deep within Fu&#x2019;s chest. He didn&#x2019;t understand why his four brothers, stacked above him in the barrel, were holding back. Like him, each had mastered a style of animal kung fu that reflected both his personality and his body type. In fact, their true natures were so perfectly matched with their kung fu styles that they were each named after the animal they mirrored. They were born to fight. But they wouldn&#x2019;t.<br><br>Fu, the tiger, growled again. His brothers didn&#x2019;t look like him, walk like him, talk like him, or even smell like him. And they certainly didn&#x2019;t think like him. He called them &#x201c;brothers&#x201d; because they all were Buddhist and lived in the temple together. In reality, he and his &#x201c;brothers&#x201d; were orphans. What Fu needed were real brothers. Brothers who would fight alongside him.<br><br>Fu grunted under the weight of the others. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe we are just going to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Please!&#x201d; Long interrupted. &#x201c;No more talking! We <i>all</i> have to remain silent. Brother Fu, focus your breathing. Meditate like the rest of us have been doing. If you find that you cannot meditate, just lie still and relax.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s easy for you to say,&#x201d; Fu replied. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re on top. Try lying down here at the bottom of the pile in a pool of water with Malao&#x2019;s nasty feet pressing up against your lips.&#x201d;<br><br>Malao giggled softly and wiggled his toes.<br><br>&#x201c;If you do that again, Malao, I&#x2019;ll bite them off one at a time,&#x201d; Fu said. &#x201c;I swear I will.&#x201d;<br><br>Malao giggled again but kept his toes still.<br><br><i>How much longer am I going to be stuck in here?</i> Fu wondered. He hoped for his brothers&#x2019; sake they would all get out of the barrel soon, because he wasn&#x2019;t sure if he could control himself much longer.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Builders of the Adytum: Tarot</h2><p>Full 22-card tarot deck in black and white based on Paul Foster Case&#39;s teachings and his adaptation of the Rider-Waite Tarot deck.</p><p></p><h2>Forgotten Voices of the Great War: A History of World War I in the Words of the Men and Women Who Were There</h2><p>FORGOTTEN VOICES OF THE GREAT WAR is the fruit of a project of the British Imperial War Museum begun in 1972 to tape-record the accounts of soldiers of all the armies involved in The Great War.<br></p><p>Forgotten Voices of the Great War is a touching, searing, and above all mesmerizing account of World War I, told in the voices of those who endured the tedium, heat, cold, pain, loss, and fear of the world&#x2019;s most brutal trench warfare to date.<br>In 1972 the British Imperial War Museum set about the momentous task of tracing ordinary veterans of World War I and interviewing them in detail about their experiences.

In three years more land - and more people - were conquered than in the preceding fifty. In 1835 James Boyce brings this pivotal moment to life. He traces the power plays in Hobart, Sydney and London, and describes the key personalities of Melbourne&#39;s early days. He conjures up the Australian frontier - its complexity, its rawness and the way its legacy is still with us today. And he asks the poignant question largely ignored for 175 years: could it have been different? With his first book, Van Diemen&#39;s Land, Boyce introduced an utterly fresh approach to the nation&#39;s history. &#34;In re-imagining Australia&#39;s past,&#34; Richard Flanagan wrote, &#34;it invents a new future.&#34; 1835 continues this untold story. &#34;Anyone who calls Melbourne home - in fact anyone who calls Australia home - should read this book.&#34; - Peter Mares &#34;A first-class piece of historical writing.

Whether chronicling the attempts of a migraine-afflicted writer to quit smoking or the loneliness of the call-centre worker, the life of a personal computer or the return of a mercurial godson, this novel in fragments evokes the disenchantments of youth and the disillusions of maturity in a Chilean society still troubled by its recent past. Written with the author&#39;s trademark irony and precision, humour and melancholy, My Documents is unflinchingly human and essential evidence of a sublimely talented writer working at the height of his powers.</p><p>Alejandro Zambra is a Chilean writer, poet, and critic. He currently teaches literature at the Diego Portales University in Santiago. His first novel, Bonsai was awarded Chile&#39;s Literary Critics&#39; Award for Best Novel. He is also the author of The Private Lives of Trees and Ways of Going Home, which won the Altazor prize and the National Council Prize for Books, both for the best Chilean novel. He was selected as one of the Best of Young Spanish-Language Novelists by Granta in 2010.

So too come startling revelations: the painful price Lyra must pay to walk through the land of the dead, the haunting power of Dr. Malone's amber spyglass, and the names of who will live - and who will die - for love. And all the while, war rages with the Kingdom of Heaven, a brutal battle that - in its shocking outcome - will uncover the secret of Dust.<br><br>Philip Pullman deftly brings the cliffhangers and mysteries of His Dark Materials to an earth-shattering conclusion and confirms his fantasy trilogy as an undoubted and enduring classic.</p><p>From the very start of its very first scene, <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> will set hearts fluttering and minds racing. All we'll say here is that we immediately discover who captured Lyra at the end of <i>The Subtle Knife</i>, though we've yet to discern whether this individual's intent is good, evil, or somewhere in between. We also learn that Will still possesses the blade that allows him to cut between worlds, and has been joined by two winged companions who are determined to escort him to Lord Asriel's mountain redoubt. The boy, however, has only one goal in mind--to rescue his friend and return to her the alethiometer, an instrument that has revealed so much to her and to readers of <i>The Golden Compass</i> and its follow-up. Within a short time, too, we get to experience the "tingle of the starlight" on Serafina Pekkala's skin as she seeks out a famished Iorek Byrnison and enlists him in Lord Asriel's crusade: <blockquote> A complex web of thoughts was weaving itself in the bear king's mind, with more strands in it than hunger and satisfaction. There was the memory of the little girl Lyra, whom he had named Silvertongue, and whom he had last seen crossing the fragile snow bridge across a crevasse in his own island of Svalbard. Then there was the agitation among the witches, the rumors of pacts and alliances and war; and then there was the surpassingly strange fact of this new world itself, and the witch's insistence that there were many more such worlds, and that the fate of them all hung somehow on the fate of the child. </blockquote> Meanwhile, two factions of the Church are vying to reach Lyra first. One is even prepared to give a priest "preemptive absolution" should he succeed in committing mortal sin. For these tyrants, killing this girl is no less than "a sacred task." <p> In the final installment of his trilogy, Philip Pullman has set himself the highest hurdles. He must match its predecessors in terms of sheer action and originality <i>and</i> resolve the enigmas he already created. The good news is that there is no critical bad news--not that <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> doesn't contain standoffs and close calls galore. (Who would have it otherwise?) But Pullman brings his audacious revision of <i>Paradise Lost</i> to a conclusion that is both serene and devastating. In prose that is transparent yet lyrical and 3-D, the author weaves in and out of his principals' thoughts. He also offers up several additional worlds. In one, Dr. Mary Malone is welcomed into an apparently simple society. The environment of the <i>mulefa</i> (again, we'll reveal nothing more) makes them rich in consciousness while their lives possess a slow and stately rhythm. These strange creatures can, however, be very fast on their feet (or on other things entirely) when necessary. Alas, they are on the verge of dying as Dust streams out of their idyllic landscape. Will the Oxford dark-matter researcher see her way to saving them, or does this require our young heroes? And while Mary is puzzling out a cure, Will and Lyra undertake a pilgrimage to a realm devoid of all light and hope, after having been forced into the cruelest of sacrifices--or betrayals. </p><p> Throughout his galvanizing epic, Pullman sustains scenes of fierce beauty and tenderness. He also allows us a moment or two of comic respite. At one point, for instance, Lyra's mother bullies a series of ecclesiastical underlings: "The man bowed helplessly and led her away. The guard behind her blew out his cheeks with relief." Needless to say, Mrs. Coulter is as intoxicating and fluid as ever.

It is a highly personal journal written during the devastation of World War II, filled with reflective passages that deal with aging, the break-up of a long term relationship, and the horrors of the war around him. It is also a wonderfully varied intellectual feast: a collection of aphorisms, epigrams, and quotations from such masters of European literature as Horace, Baudelaire, Sainte-Beuve, Flaubert, and Goethe.

Instead of scapegoating television as the cause of crime in our streets, stupidity in our schools, and spectacle rather than substance in our government, Leonard sees something else inside the box: an echo chamber and a feedback loop, a medium neither wholly innocent of, nor entirely responsible for, the frantic disorder it brings to our homes.</p><p>Taking on topics from kid shows to cable, from the cheap thrills of action adventures to the solemn boredom of pledge drives, Leonard argues for a whole new way of thinking about television.</p><br></p><p>You can't find a smarter, more savvy, and learned couch potato than John Leonard, the literary editor of <i>The Nation</i> and television critic for <i>New York</i> magazine and <i>CBS Sunday Morning</i>. In the pages of <i>Smoke and Mirrors</i> he accomplishes something close to the unthinkable: he creates a convincing case for the merits of our collective viewing habits through thoughtful essays on what television tells us about ourselves. At times Leonard's knowledge of television programming can be overwhelming, as he clicks through the history of long-canceled programs with a frightening intimacy. In contrast to real T.V., Leonard always offers up something worth tuning into. He treats our tired, media-saturated eyes to such topics as what detective programs reveal about out confidence in the individual, how our sense of national coherence has fractured into multitudinous channels of individual identity, and what talk shows express about the need for a collective legitimation. Leonard's arguments might not always sway the reader, but unlike the boob tube, he rarely disappoints.Smoke and Mirrors is a passionate, richly nuanced work that shows television as a circus, a wishing well, and a cure for loneliness. Ranging from Ed Sullivan to cyberspace, from kid shows to cable, and from the cheap thrills of &#34;action adventure&#34; to the solemn boredom of PBS pledge week, Leonard argues for a whole new way of thinking about television. For Leonard, the situation comedy is a socializing agency, the talk show is a legitimating agency, the made-for-television movie is the last redoubt of social conscience, and television criticism itself is the last refuge of time-serving thugs and postmodernists. Instead of scapegoating television as the cause of crime in our streets, stupidity in our schools, and spectacle rather than substance in our government, Leonard sees something else inside the box: an echo chamber and a feedback loop, a medium neither wholly innocent of nor entirely responsible for the frantic disorder it brings into our homes.</p><h2>Boys Over Flowers, Vol. 21</h2><p>The story of Tsukushi, an average teenage girl with the courage to stand up for her rights.

Reprint.</p><p>A good investigative reporter will dig deep into her subject, attempting to enlighten her readers' knowledge. <i>Washington Post</i> reporter Thompson does that here, although in this case the subject is the personally difficult one of her own "beast" --her history of depression. Drawing on her journals from adolescence onward, Thompson details her emotional and mental history in brief, impressionistic scenes, creating a mosaic of the human mind's emotional complexities. Colloquially referred to as "the doldrums" or being "blue" or "low," depression has come to be regarded as a genuine illness, something requiring not only counseling, but medical intervention. Depression affects millions, and costs the U.S. economy $43.7 billion in medical expenses and lost productivity. Thompson fleshes it out informatively and compassionately.

R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien&#39;s earlier work, The Hobbit, but developed into a much larger story. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, with much of it being created during World War II.[1] Although intended as a single-volume work, it was originally published in three volumes in 1954 and 1955, and it is in this three-volume form that it is popularly known. It has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into many different languages,[2] becoming one of the most popular and influential works in 20th-century literature.</p><p></p><h2>Cages</h2><p>Presents a tale about the inhabitants of an apartment building, including a blocked painter, a controversial novelist, and a wise musician</p><p>Dave McKean is best known for his regular collaboration with Neil Gaiman, during which he has created covers for every single issue and one-shot of Sandman, (now collected as Titan&#39;s The Sandman: Dustcovers), Violent Cases, Signal to Noise, Black Orchid and Mr. Punch. Also celebrated for his work with Grant Morrison on the classic Batman: Arkham Asylum, Cages represents McKean&#39;s first major solo work.Best known for his work with Neil Gaiman, McKean is also an accomplished cartoonist in his own right. This is his magnum opus to date: an immense, pulsing graphic novel that's also a treatise on art, creativity and the uses and misuses of technique. Originally serialized between 1990 and 1996 (and collected in 1998), it's been out of print for several years. The book's plot is fairly rudimentary: a painter, a writer and a musician who live in the same apartment building find their lives intersecting. But the book's gradual shift from literalism to fanciful allegories and stories-within-stories mostly serves as the springboard for a visual tour de force. For most of the book, McKean restricts himself to wobbly, jagged two-tone pen-and-ink drawings, occasionally in the manner of Egon Schiele. But he often signals shifts in storytelling mode by switching media or style (to ink-wash brushwork, airbrushed photography, white-on-black "woodcuts," bold near-abstractions or whatever seems appropriate); when the artwork erupts into full-color paintings and collages, the effect is explosive. Even when the story falters or drifts into endless philosophical chitchat, McKean's artwork saves the day. His characters, built out of crazily bent lines and splatters, have perfectly choreographed body language, and his daring visual experiments serve the ideological goals of his writing.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>And Sarah Saw</h2><p>Like Sarah of old, Christians today look for alternate solutions to receive what god has promised. Sarah&#39;s promise was a son, but when the promise delayed, she found a surrogate. Ishmael was the result, and when the promised child Isaac did arrive, Sarah saw Ishmael mocking her son, to the point that her solution nearly killed her promise. In this powerful book Frances Swaggart uncovers the mockery now taking place in the nation and in the church against the sacred institution of marriage, the education of our children, the Work of God, and the rights and freedoms of the citizens living in the United States of America. This book reminds believers of the spiritual discernment that God gives to Christians to help them see what is good and what is evil.</p><p></p><h2>The Playbill Broadway Yearbook: June 2013 to May 2014</h2><p>Taking the format of a school yearbook, the tenth edition of <i>The Playbill Broadway Yearbook</i> is packed with photos (more than 4 000, many in color) and memorabilia from the entire 2013-2014 Broadway season.<br><br>This edition documents the more than 70 Broadway shows of that season &#x2013; which is every show that ran during the season &#x2013; not just the new shows like <i>Bullets Over Broadway</i>, <i>Aladdin</i>, <i>After Midnight</i>, <i>Bridges of Madison County</i>, <i>If/Then</i> and <i>Beautiful</i>, but the long-running ones from seasons past, like <i>The Book of Mormon</i>, <i>Matilda</i>, <i>Once</i>, <i>Motown</i>, and <i>Wicked</i>.

This would be his seventh trip this spring up to the heights at Walnut Creek, and he knew the best gossips in the valley would be making sport of him again today.</p><p>What could draw old Mervin out so early, they&#x2019;d be asking each other so delicately. Was it really the Coblentz chocolate? Was he just a retired old farmer out for a drive? Maybe he just liked to show off his high-stepping racehorse. Or could it be the widow Stutzman?</p><p>Oh, how they&#x2019;d sure be buzzing today, Mervin thought. <i>Why yes</i>&#x2014;he smiled&#x2014;<i>it looks as if he&#x2019;s washed his best Sunday rig again</i>.</p><p>Mervin stepped out into the cold air in a new Amish-blue denim suit and stood on the front porch of his white clapboard Daadihaus, set back twenty paces from the wide gravel drive that curled around the back of the big house. A cool breeze tugged at his white chin whiskers, and a gust caught under the wide brim of his black felt hat, nearly lifting it from his head. He settled the warm hat back into place and stood to enjoy the familiar sounds of the farm&#x2014;all the family, parents and kids alike, at work since well before dawn.</p><p>In the woodshop behind the barn, that was his oldest son Daniel he heard, running lumber through the tabletop saw. Lowing as they nipped at the hay in the feeders, the milking cows were back on the hillside pastures beyond. The youngest kids were bringing baskets of eggs out of the henhouse. And beside the big house, an older grandson was starting a gasoline generator, charging the marine batteries for the several electric appliances the family kept&#x2014;a phone in a little shed out by the road, a secret radio for severe weather, half a dozen lightbulbs where safety called for something other than kerosene lanterns, and an electric butter churn that Mervin had brought home on a whim from Lehman&#x2019;s hardware in Kidron.</p><p>Standing on his front porch, Mervin listened with satisfaction to the familiar sounds of morning chores, the rhythms of family life on the farm. In his day, when the farm had been theirs, he and his Leona had been accustomed to early rising, too. They had owned the farm for forty years, and then they had lived together for seven more happy years in their little Daadihaus, watching Daniel and Becky raise their own, in the same home where Mervin and Leona Byler had raised their twelve. It&#x2019;s fitting, Mervin thought. The old move aside for the young, who in turn honor their parents with the gift of a new home.</p><p>Byler sighed and thought about Leona, gone for nearly three years. So fine a woman; so many good years. Now their little Daadihaus was a lonely place for him, and Mervin had fallen into slack habits. Most would say it was shameful, the way he ignored the chores. He slept in, and he got up when it suited him. Mervin Byler figured he had earned his rest.</p><p>Truth be told, Leona might say it was a bit much. When they had retired, she had insisted that they rise with the others and tend to their share of the chores, too. But now Mervin gladly let the sons plant and harvest the crops, tend to the livestock, handle all the duties on the farm. Mervin Byler was retired, and he had fun and suitable places to be, never mind what the gossips might say about the widow Stutzman. He felt young again, and he knew with the wisdom of age that that feeling was not to be squandered.</p><p>With great satisfaction over his prospects for the morning, Byler noted that the stiff breeze was snatching a thin gray line of smoke from the chimney of Becky&#x2019;s kitchen stove, at the back of the big house. The fire is still going, he thought. As late as it was, there would still be hot coffee in her pot. Maybe he could take some of Becky&#x2019;s biscuits, too. Wrap them in a towel for the trip. Byler considered it briefly.</p><p>But his best mare was already hitched and waiting on the drive, shuddering from the energy bottled up in her limbs. Just like Mervin, she was eager to begin.</p><p>Mervin clipped down the wooden steps on his new leather soles and climbed into his Sunday buggy, laughing at himself. Thinking that he could already hear the chatter. Knowing what the valley gossips would say if they ever got a look inside his cupboards, stuffed full to bursting with Coblentz chocolates of every kind. They would be asking themselves why an old man needed to be driving back to Walnut Creek again when his cupboards were already shamefully overstocked with more sweets than any sensible man could eat.</p><p>For the fun of it, he ought to drop a hint somewhere along the line. Put it out there among the talkers that he didn&#x2019;t really like chocolate that much. Truth be told, he favored salty chips more than sweets. Wonderful, crunchy, salty chips of every kind.</p><p>Just tell one of them, he thought, and soon they&#x2019;d all be a-chatter. He&#x2019;d make a few trips into Walmart for a dozen bags of Ruffles, and that news would be singing like electric in the wires. <i>Why, don&#x2019;t you know? Mervin doesn&#x2019;t really like sweets at all.</i> Then he could enjoy the sparks. He couldn&#x2019;t remember a time when he had felt so young.</p><p>But don&#x2019;t kid yourself, Mervin smiled. Today I&#x2019;ll just tap the glass. See if she&#x2019;ll come around to the tourists&#x2019; gallery for a chat. Maybe he could visit on Sunday with the North Walnut Creek Lehmans, and stay after services for the social. Then his valley would sure be all a-buzz. Was it the Coblentz chocolates or the widow Stutzman? A Sunday visit in old Ben Lehman&#x2019;s district would settle it for sure. They&#x2019;d all be talking for over a month.</p><p>Mervin climbed up, took the reins, and walked his buggy out to the lane in front of the big house. He turned right to follow Township Lane 166 toward the north, thinking that maybe she&#x2019;d give him a look today. Something to help him make up his mind. But hadn&#x2019;t she done that already the last time he had visited? Mervin wasn&#x2019;t sure. Was it a look, or was it a smile? Maybe it was just a glance.</p><p>Yes, at the time, he had thought it was just a glance. Now it seemed to him that it might have been more than that. Was it really encouragement for a suitor, or was she mocking an old fool?</p><p>Never mind, he told himself. I&#x2019;ll tap on the glass today. Then she&#x2019;ll give me one look or the other look, and I&#x2019;ll know if I should bother with any more chocolates from the Coblentz store. Not that there&#x2019;s room in my cupboards.</p><p>He set a good pace for his horse and took the reins in his left hand. With his right, he fished his money roll out of the side pocket of his denim trousers. It was a suitable sum, he thought. Four hundred and eighty-seven dollars, most of it in tens and twenties. He wouldn&#x2019;t need nearly that much. Still a man ought to be prepared. Maybe after he stopped in Walnut Creek, he&#x2019;d run up Route 39 to the Walmart in Millersburg. That&#x2019;d put him home after dark. Smiling broadly, he thought how that news would spread itself around among the folk. Up to Walnut Creek for the widow Stutzman and way over to Millersburg just for chips? There&#x2019;d be no end of the talk.</p><p>At the intersection with Township 165, Byler turned left and took the gravel lane where it cut a gap in the remote southeastern corner of Holmes County. Exhausted from a brutal winter, most fields lay bare on the rolling hills, but some had been plowed already, their tidy rows of newly turned earth looking eagerly dark and moist for planting.</p><p>On the slope to his left, he saw the new shoots of winter wheat promising the harvest in July. Ahead on his right stood the stubble of feed corn cut last autumn, the arching rows of blunted shafts curving gracefully over the crest.</p><p>Take the back roads today, Byler thought. No sense getting out on SR 39, where the traffic is so crazy. When had the tourists discovered Walnut Creek? Twenty years ago, there hadn&#x2019;t been anything at all in the little town. Now it was overbuilt for commerce, and the traffic was incessant, with out-of-state plates and buses from all the big cities.</p><p>Mervin frowned. He gave the reins a determined slap. Back roads will take longer, he told himself, but the trip will be safer, and you&#x2019;ll get there in one piece, you old fool. So stick to the backmost roads.</p><p>The narrow wheels of his buggy cut fine, wavy lines into the gravel and mud of the lane, and he gave the reins another slap to encourage his horse. The whisper music of his buggy wheels running in the wet gravel and the clipping rhythm of his horse&#x2019;s hooves spoke peacefulness to him. Coblentz chocolate and the widow Stutzman. Who could ask for a better morning?</p><p>Following the creek that was fed by the spring on the Yoder farm, he traveled generally north and west, and made the sharp right turn where the road curved to the north. The glade that lay ahead to his left was lined by sycamores whose old roots sank deep into the rocky cut of the creek. A stand of barren maples beside the road sheltered the little glade from view at fi rst, but soon he reached the clearing beside the road, where the Yoders maintained a service road for an oil well. Behind the low knoll, Byler could see the top of the wellhead where the Yoders took off their natural gas feed, and beside that stood a green tank for the oil that was being pumped slowly out of the ground.</p><p>As he skirted the glade, however, Byler saw a horse and buggy standing at the back of the clearing, beside the bend in the service road. The horse was tethered to a sapling, and it was bucking wildly in its harness, its head popping up and down and back and forth as it whipped the leather reins that were tied to the tree.</p><p>Byler stopped, climbed down from his rig, and circled around through tangled brush to reach the front of the horse, not wanting to agitate it any further by coming up on its rear. As he approached, he called out to the horse, &#x201c;Hey there! Hey, big fella! Whoa!&#x201d;</p><p>But as he pushed through the brambles, his feet crunching twigs and fallen branches, the horse bucked and danced all the more, its hooves striking strangely to the right and left, as if it were trying to sidestep a rattlesnake. As if it couldn&#x2019;t bear to let its footfalls touch the ground.</p><p>And that&#x2019;s when Byler first saw the girl lying underneath the rear hooves of the horse. An Amish girl in a forest-green dress, wearing the black denim jacket of a man. Sprawled under the hooves of the frantic horse. Trampled facedown in the mud beside the spring. Clothes caked with bloodied mud, arms and legs sprawled to the sides like broken twigs. The hair at the back of her head matted with blood from a gaping hole in her skull. The frightened horse pounding out its terror on her back.</p><p>Byler stepped up to the sapling and drew his pocketknife. He cut once at the reins wrapped around the trunk, but failed to sever the hold. He cut again with more force, and the leather gave way, but still held. Then he slashed with his blade a third time, and the reins snapped free, sending the horse bolting off to the side, dragging the wheels of the buggy sideways over the body of the girl, flipping her onto her back. The horse and buggy disappeared around the curve of the lane. Staring down at the trampled body of the girl, Byler could hear the plaintive cries of the horse as it struggled to free itself from the harness. He knelt to brush mud from her face and felt a round wound in her forehead.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Each time the buggy bounced out of a chuckhole, it seemed to Byler that it actually flew. He whipped the horse again and tried to keep his seat as he raced back home to the phone booth beside the road. Thirty yards out, he started slowing the horse, but he overshot the phone. Not bothering to steady or tether the horse, Byler hopped down beside the picket fence in front of Daniel&#x2019;s house, let the horse pace forward to stop on its own, dashed into the phone booth, pulled the receiver to his ear, and tried to turn the dial. His fingers were shaking badly, and it took him three tries to swing the dial around to get 911.</p><p>Groaning as he waited for an answer, Mervin&#x2019;s feet marched out a manic step in place, inside the tight confines of the little shed. When the operator answered, he shouted, &#x201c;Dead girl!&#x201d; as loud as he could, and repeated it, saying, &#x201c;I found a dead girl!&#x201d;</p><p>He dropped the receiver, pushed back through the door, and ran for the house, shouting, &#x201c;Daniel! Becky! Get help!&#x201d;</p><p>Then he remembered the phone and ran back to the booth. When he picked up the receiver, the operator started asking him questions, and he answered them as best he could.</p><p>&#x201c;Beside the Yoders&#x2019; spring.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s Holmes County. At the big bend of Township 165 and 166.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s dead, I tell you. Get the sheriff!</p><p>&#x201c;Because I felt a hole in her forehead! When I tried to brush the mud out of her eyes.&#x201d;</p><p>Then, with his thoughts muddled by adrenaline, Mervin answered several more questions, while Daniel and Becky stood outside the phone booth with anxious questions in their eyes.</p><p>Mervin finished his call, laid the handset back on its cradle, and stood alone inside, trying to understand how he could manage to do what the man on the phone had asked him to do&#x2014;to go back, to wait there, and to talk with the deputies when they arrived.</p><p>He turned in place, opened the door, and stepped outside to tell Daniel and Becky what he had seen. But several of the children had gathered with their parents, so he drew Daniel aside to whisper.</p><p>As he did so, Mervin Byler couldn&#x2019;t remember a time when he had felt so old.</p><br><br><p><b>2 </b></p><p><i>Monday, April 4 </i></p><p><i>8:40 a.m. </i></p><p>Detective Sergeant Ricky Niell followed a circuitous route to meet Mervin Byler. When the call had come in, he had been in Berlin, to the north, taking a statement from a local who had been knocked down by an impatient tourist hurrying to park his car in a prized spot at the curb. The injured man was sitting on a bench in front of the old Boyd and Wurthmann Restaurant while paramedics splinted his ankle. All around him flowed the early morning circus of a society gone hideously commercial, with English tourists thronging the sidewalks, cars and tour buses clogging the main road and all of the side streets, and garish music playing from loudspeakers outside the trinket establishments that so many English folk considered to be authentic country treasures.</p><p>Frustrated by the spectacle, Niell left Berlin abruptly. He followed SR 39 south and east out of town, dropped down off the crest at Walnut Creek, pushed around the long, sweeping curve, and turned south on TR 420. He needed to hurry, but the country lanes were narrow, pitched steeply, and curved dangerously. With mounting urgency, he forced his cruiser around a series of sharp turns and switchbacks, traveling deeper into the secluded hillside pasturelands north of Baltic. TR 420 to County 140, then TR 141, TR 164, County 70, back onto TR 164, and finally left and south again on TR 165, driving ever slower as the lanes constricted and turned to gravel and mud.</p><p>After another tortuous quarter mile of frustration, Niell stopped, punched up a wider view on his GPS display, and studied it to see how deeply into the isolated countryside he had managed to penetrate.

When the Nazis invaded Denmark on Tuesday, April 9, 1940, the people of this tiny country to the north of Germany awoke to a devastating surprise. The government of Denmark surrendered quietly, and the Danes were ordered to go about their daily lives as if nothing had changed. But everything had changed. Award-winning author Deborah Hopkinson traces the stories of the heroic young men and women who would not stand by as their country was occupied by a dangerous enemy. Rather, they fought back. Some were spies, passing tactical information to the British; some were saboteurs, who aimed to hamper and impede Nazi operations in Denmark; and 95% of the Jewish population of Denmark were survivors, rescued by their fellow countrymen, who had the courage and conscience that drove them to act. With her talent for digging deep in her research and weaving real voices into her narratives, Hopkinson reveals the thrilling truth behind one of WWII&#39;s most daring resistance movements.</p><p></p><h2>The Illuminated Manuscript</h2><p>The British Library houses one of the world&#39;s great collections of illuminated manuscripts, and Janet Backhouse has drawn on this resource to make a selection of examples that span over 800 years of medieval book production.</p><p>Janet Backhouse was Assistant Keeper in the Department of Manuscripts at the British Library.

Jack McColl, a Scottish car salesman with an uncanny ear for languages, has always hoped to make a job for himself as a spy. As his sales calls take him from city to great city&#x2014;Hong Kong to Shanghai to San Francisco to New York&#x2014;he moonlights collecting intelligence for His Majesty's Secret Service, but British espionage is in its infancy and Jack has nothing but a shoestring budget and the very tenuous protection of a boss in far-away London. He knows, though, that a geopolitical catastrophe is brewing, and now is both the moment to prove himself and the moment his country needs him most. <br><br>Unfortunately, this is also the moment he begins to realize what his aspiration might cost him. He understands his life is at stake when activities in China suddenly escalate from innocent data-gathering and casual strolls along German military concessions to arrest warrants and knife attacks. Meanwhile, a sharp, vivacious American suffragette journalist has wiled her way deep into his affections, and it is not long before he realizes that her Irish-American family might be embroiled in the Irish Republican movement Jack's bosses are fighting against. How can he choose between his country and the woman he loves? And would he even be able to make such a choice without losing both?</p><p>David Downing grew up in suburban London. He is the author of<i> One Man&#x2019;s Flag</i>, <i>The Red Eagles</i>, and six books in the John Russell espionage series set in WWII Berlin: <i>Zoo Station</i>, <i>Silesian Station</i>, <i>Stettin Station</i>, <i>Potsdam Station</i>, <i>Lehrter Station</i>, and <i>Masaryk Station</i>. He lives with his wife, an American acupuncturist, in Guildford, England.At the foot of the hill, Tsingtau&#x2019;s Government House stood alone on a slight mound, its gabled upper-floor windows and elegant corner tower looking out across the rest of the town. Substantial German houses with red-tiled roofs peppered the slope leading down to the Pacific beach and pier; beyond them the even grander buildings of the commercial district fronted the bay and its harbors. Away to the right, the native township of Taipautau offered little in the way of variety&#x2014;the houses were smaller, perhaps a bit closer together, but more European than classically Chinese. In less than two decades, the Germans had come, organized, and recast this tiny piece of Asia in their own image. Give them half a chance, Jack McColl mused, and they would do the same for the rest of the world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He remembered the Welsh mining engineer leaning over the <i>Moldavia</i>&#x2019;s rail in mid&#x2013;Indian Ocean and spoiling a beautiful day with tales of the atrocities the Germans had committed in South-West Africa over the last few years. At least a hundred thousand Africans had perished. Many of the native men had died in battle; most of the remainder, along with the women and children, had been driven into the desert, where some thoughtful German had already poisoned the water holes. A few lucky ones had ended up in concentration camps, where a doctor named Fischer had used them for a series of involuntary medical experiments. Children had been injected with smallpox, typhus, tuberculosis.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The white man&#x2019;s burden, as conceived in Berlin. McColl had passed two descending Germans on his way up the hill, but the well-kept viewing area had been empty, and there was no sign of other sightseers below. To the east the hills rose into a jagged horizon, and the earthworks surrounding the 28-centimeter guns on Bismarck Hill were barely visible against the mountains beyond. Some magnification would have helped,<br>but an Englishman training binoculars on foreign defenses was likely to arouse suspicion, and from what he&#x2019;d seen so far, the guns were where the Admiralty had thought they would be. There was some building work going on near the battery that covered Auguste-Victoria Bay, but not on a scale that seemed significant. He might risk a closer look early one morning, when the army was still drilling.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The East Asia Squadron was where it had been the day before&#x2014;<i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Emden</i> sharing the long jetty, <i>Gneisenau </i>and <i>N�rnberg</i> anchored in the bay beyond. <i>Leipzig </i>had been gone a week now&#x2014;to the Marianas, if his Chinese informer was correct. Several coalers were lined up farther out, and one was unloading by the onshore wharves, sending occasional clouds of black dust up into the clear, cold air.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These ships were the reason for his brief visit, these ships and what they might do if war broke out. Their presence was no secret, of course&#x2014;the local British consul probably played golf with the admiral in command. The same consul could have kept<br>the Admiralty informed about Tsingtau&#x2019;s defenses and done his best to pump his German counterpart for military secrets, but of course he hadn&#x2019;t. Such work was considered ungentlemanly by the fools who ran the Foreign Office and staffed its embassies&#x2014;not that long ago a British military attach� had refused to tell his employers in London what he&#x2019;d witnessed at his host country&#x2019;s military maneuvers, on the grounds that he&#x2019;d be breaking a confidence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was left to part-time spies to do the dirty work. Over the last few years, McColl&#x2014;and, he presumed, other British businessmen who traveled the world&#x2014;had been approached and asked to ferret out those secrets the empire&#x2019;s enemies wanted kept. The man who employed them on this part-time basis was an old naval officer named Cumming, who worked from an office in Whitehall and answered, at least in theory, to the Admiralty and its political masters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it came to Tsingtau, the secret that mattered most was what orders the East Asia Squadron had for the day that a European war broke out. Any hard evidence as to their intentions, as Cumming had told McColl on their farewell stroll down the Embankment, would be &#x201c;really appreciated.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His insistence on how vital all this was to the empire&#x2019;s continued well-being had been somewhat undermined by his allocation of a paltry three hundred pounds for global expenses, but the trip as a whole had been slightly more lucrative than McColl<br>had expected. The luxury Maia automobile that he was hawking around the world&#x2014;the one now back in Shanghai, he hoped, with his brother Jed and colleague Mac&#x2014;had caught the fancy of several rulers hungry for initiation into the seductive world of motorized speed, and the resultant orders had at least paid the trio&#x2019;s traveling bills.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was gratifying, but probably more of a swan song than a sign of things to come. The automobile business was not what it had been even two years before, not for the small independents&#x2014;nowadays you needed capital, and lots of it. Spying, on the other hand, seemed an occupation with a promising future. Over the last few years, even the British had realized the need for an espionage service, and once the men holding the purse strings finally got past the shame of it all, they would realize that only a truly professional body would do. One that paid a commensurate salary.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A war would probably help, but until Europe&#x2019;s governments were stupid enough to start one, McColl would have to make do with piecework. Before McColl&#x2019;s departure from England the previous autumn, Cumming had taken note of his planned itinerary<br>and returned with a list of &#x201c;little jobs&#x201d; that McColl could do in the various ports of call&#x2014;a wealthy renegade to assess in Cairo, a fellow Brit to investigate in Bombay, the Germans here in Tsingtau. Their next stop with the Maia was San Francisco, where a ragtag bunch of Indian exiles were apparently planning the empire&#x2019;s demise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of it seemed pretty inconsequential to McColl. There were no doubt plenty of would-be picadors intent on goading the imperial bull, but it didn&#x2019;t seem noticeably weaker. And where was the matador to finish it off? The Kaiser probably practiced sword strokes in his bedroom mirror, but it would be a long time before Germany acquired the necessary global reach.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lit a German cigarette and stared out across the town. The sun was dropping toward the distant horizon, the harbor lighthouse glowing brighter by the minute. The lines of lamps in the warship rigging reminded him of Christmas trees.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would be back in Shanghai for the Chinese New Year, he realized.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Caitlin Hanley, the young American woman he&#x2019;d met in Peking, was probably there already. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun was an orange orb, almost touching the distant hills. He ground out the cigarette and started back down the uneven path while he could still see his way. Two hopeful coolies were waiting with their rickshaws at the bottom, but he waved them both away and walked briskly down Bismarckstrasse toward the beach. There were lights burning in the British consulate, but no other sign of life within.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His hotel was at the western end of the waterfront, beyond the deserted pleasure pier. The desk clerk still had his hair in a pigtail&#x2014;an increasingly rare sight in Shanghai but common enough in Tsingtau, where German rule offered little encouragement to China&#x2019;s zealous modernizers. The room key changed hands with the usual bow and blank expression, and McColl climbed the stairs to his second-floor room overlooking the ocean.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A quick check revealed that someone had been though his possessions, which was only to be expected&#x2014;Tsingtau might be a popular summer destination with all sorts of foreigners, but an Englishman turning up in January was bound to provoke some suspicion. Whoever it was had found nothing to undermine his oft-repeated story, that he was here in China on business and seeing as much of the country as money and<br>time would allow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went back downstairs to the restaurant. Most of the clientele were German businessmen in stiff collars and spats, either eager to grab their slice of China or boasting of claims already staked. There were also a handful of officers, including one in a uniform McColl didn&#x2019;t recognize. He was enthusiastically outlining plans for establishing an aviation unit in Tsingtau when he noticed McColl&#x2019;s arrival and abruptly stopped to ask the man beside him something.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Pluschow, he doesn&#x2019;t speak German,&#x201d; was the audible answer, which allowed the exposition to continue. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since his arrival in Tsingtau, McColl had taken pains to stress his sad lack of linguistic skills, and this was not the first time the lie had worked to his advantage. Apparently absorbed in his month-old <i>Times</i>, he listened with interest to the aviation enthusiast. He couldn&#x2019;t see much strategic relevance in the news&#x2014;what could a few German planes hope to achieve so far from home?&#x2014;but the Japanese might well be interested. And any little nugget of intelligence should be worth a few of Cumming&#x2019;s precious pounds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conversation took a less interesting tack, and eventually the party broke up. McColl sipped his Russian tea and idly wondered where he would dine later that evening. He glanced through the paper for the umpteenth time and reminded himself that he needed fresh reading for the Pacific crossing. There was a small shop he knew on Shanghai&#x2019;s Nanking Road where novels jettisoned by foreigners mysteriously ended up. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More people came in&#x2014;two older Germans in naval uniform, who ignored him, and a stout married couple, who returned his smile of acknowledgment with almost risible Prussian hauteur.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was getting up to leave when Rainer von Sch�n appeared. McColl had met the young German soon after arriving in Tsingtau&#x2014;they were both staying at this hotel&#x2014;and taken an instant liking to him. The fact that von Sch�n spoke near-perfect English made conversation easy, and the man himself was likable and intelligent. A water engineer by trade, he had admitted to a bout of homesickness and delved into his wallet for an explanatory photo of his pretty wife and daughter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That evening he had an English edition of William Le Queux&#x2019;s <i>Invasion of 1910</i> under his arm. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What do you think of it?&#x201d; McColl asked him once the waiter had taken the German&#x2019;s order.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, several things. It&#x2019;s so badly written, for one. The plot&#x2019;s ridiculous, and the tone is hysterical.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But otherwise you like it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Von Sch�n smiled. &#x201c;It is strangely entertaining. And the fact that so many English people bought it makes it fascinating to a German. And a little scary, I have to say.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you have any ranters in Germany?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Von Sch�n leaned slightly forward, a mischievous expression on his face. &#x201c;With the Kaiser at the helm, we don&#x2019;t need them.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McColl laughed. &#x201c;So what have you been doing today?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Finishing up, actually. I&#x2019;ll be leaving in a couple of days.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Homeward bound?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Eventually. I have work in Tokyo first. But after that . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, if I don&#x2019;t see you before you go, have a safe journey.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You, too.&#x201d; Von Sch�n drained the last of his schnapps and got to his feet. &#x201c;And now I have someone I need to see.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the German was gone, McColl consulted his watch. It was time he visited the Blue Dragon, before the evening rush began. He left a generous tip, recovered his winter coat from the downstairs cloakroom, and walked out to the waiting line of rickshaws.<br>The temperature had already dropped appreciably, and he was hugging himself as the coolie turned left onto the well-lit Friedrichstrasse and started up the hill. The shops were closed by this time, the restaurants readying themselves for their evening trade. The architecture, the faces, the cooking smells, all were European&#x2014;apart from his coolie, the only Chinese in sight was a man collecting horse dung.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was quiet, too&#x2014;so quiet that the sudden blast of a locomotive whistle from the nearby railway station made him jump.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coolie reached the brow of the low hill and started down the opposite slope into Taipautau. The township was almost as neat and widely spaced as the German districts, and in the cold air even the smells seemed more muted than they had in Shanghai. They were halfway down Shantung Strasse before McColl could hear the beginnings of evening revelry in the sailors&#x2019; bars at the bottom.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Blue Dragon was open for business but not yet really awake. The usual old man sat beneath the candlelit lanterns on the rickety veranda, beside the screened-off entrance. He grinned when he recognized McColl and cheerfully spat on the floor to his right, adding one more glistening glob to an impressive mosaic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McColl was barely through the doorway when an old woman hurried down the hall toward him. &#x201c;This way, please!&#x201d; she insisted in pidgin German. &#x201c;All type girls!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to see Hsu Ch&#x2019;ing-lan,&#x201d; he told her in Mandarin, but she just looked blank. &#x201c;Hsu Ch&#x2019;ing-lan,&#x201d; he repeated.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name seemed to percolate. She gestured for him to follow and led him through to the reception area, where &#x201c;all type girls&#x201d; were waiting in an assortment of tawdry traditional costumes on long red-velvet sofas. Some were barely out of puberty, others close to menopause. One seemed amazingly large for a Chinese woman, causing McColl to wonder whether she&#x2019;d been fattened up to satisfy some particular Prussian yearning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old woman led him down the corridor beyond, put her head around the final door, and told Madame that a <i>laowai </i>wanted to see her. Assent forthcoming, she ushered McColl inside.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hsu Ch&#x2019;ing-lan was sitting at her desk, apparently doing her accounts. Some kind of incense was burning in a large dragon holder beyond, sending up coils of smoke.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Herr McColl,&#x201d; she said with an ironic smile. &#x201c;Please. Take a seat.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was wearing the usual dress, blue silk embroidered in silver and gold, ankle-length but slit to the hip. Her hair was piled up in curls, secured by what looked like an ornamental chopstick. She was in her thirties, he guessed, and much more desirable than any of the girls in reception. When they&#x2019;d first met, she&#x2019;d told him that she was a retired prostitute, as if that were a major achievement. It probably was.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had ch...</p><h2>Perry Mason (TV Milestones Series)</h2><p><p>Perry Mason was one of the most successful television programs from the 1950s and remains one of the most influential crime melodramas from any period. The show's influence goes far beyond its nine-year tenure (1957-66), the millions of dollars it generated for its creators and for CBS, and the definitive identification it provided its star, Raymond Burr. Perry Mason has become a true piece of Americana, evolving through a formulaic approach that law professors continue to use today as a teaching tool.</p><p>In his examination of Perry Mason, author Thomas Leitch looks at why this series has appealed to so many for so long and what the continued appeal tells us about Americans' attitudes toward lawyers and the law, then and now. Beginning with its roots in earlier detective fiction, stories of fictional attorneys, and the work of Erle Stanley Gardner (the show's creator), Leitch lays out the circumstances under which Perry Mason was conceived and marketed as a distinct franchise. The evolution of Perry Mason is charted here in an inclusive manner, discussing the show's broadcast history (ending with the series of two-hour telemovies that aired nearly twenty years after the original series ended) alongside its generic nature and place within popular culture, the show's ideological dynamic, and issues of authorship in the context of television. This concise study is an excellent tool for television and media scholars as well as fans of the Perry Mason series.</p></p><p>An exploration of the enduring popularity of the television series Perry Mason and its universal reputation as the most formulaic program in the history of broadcast television.Thomas Leitch is professor of English and director of the Film Studies Program at the University of Delaware.

His most celebrated novels include Pied Piper (1942), No Highway (1948), A Town Like Alice (1950) and On the Beach (1957).The second published novel by the celebrated author of ON THE BEACH is very, very British. The conventional thriller could have been filmed by a young Hitchcock. Driving home one evening, a veteran of the Great War picks up a hitchhiker whom he recognizes as a fellow flying ace. He shelters the basically good chap, who admits to spying for the Soviets. How to reform the bloke, protect him from authorities, and foil the Russians? Stephen Thorne has just the right sound for this tale. He transports us to the age of biplanes, "playing the game," and Etonian rules of decency.

Entirely through its own internal development, the novel shows the rich inner rewards of black pride, love, and independence despite the certainty of outer defeat." &#x2014;<b>Booklist</b> (starred review) <p> * Newbery Medal Award<br> * American Book Award Honor Book<br> * An ALA Notable Book<br> * A NCSS-CBC Notable Children's Trade Book in the Field of Social Studies<br> * A Boston Globe-Horn Book Award Honor Book<br> </p></p><p>In all Mildred D. Taylor's unforgettable novels she recounts "not only the joy of growing up in a large and supportive family, but my own feelings of being faced with segregation and bigotry." Her Newbery Medal-winning <i>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</i> tells the story of one African American family, fighting to stay together and strong in the face of brutal racist attacks, illness, poverty, and betrayal in the Deep South of the 1930s. Nine-year-old Cassie Logan, growing up protected by her loving family, has never had reason to suspect that any white person could consider her inferior or wish her harm. But during the course of one devastating year when her community begins to be ripped apart by angry night riders threatening African Americans, she and her three brothers come to understand why the land they own means so much to their Papa. "Look out there, Cassie girl. All that belongs to you. You ain't never had to live on nobody's place but your own and long as I live and the family survives, you'll never have to. That's important. You may not understand that now but one day you will. Then you'll see."<p> Twenty-five years after it was first published, this special anniversary edition of the classic strikes as deep and powerful a note as ever. Taylor's vivid portrayal of ugly racism and the poignancy of Cassie's bewilderment and gradual toughening against social injustice and the men and women who perpetuate it, will remain with readers forever. Two award-winning sequels, <i>Let the Circle Be Unbroken</i> and <i>The Road to Memphis</i>, and a long-awaited prequel, <i>The Land</i>, continue the profoundly moving tale of the Logan family.

It takes the events of one turbulent year--the year of the night riders and the burnings, the year a white girl humiliates Cassie in public simply because she is black--to show Cassie that having a place of their own is the Logan family's lifeblood. It is the land that gives the Logans their courage and pride, for no matter how others may degrade them, the Logans possess something no one can take away.</p><h2>Upholstery Techniques &amp; Projects</h2><p>&#x201c;Contains individual furniture projects that are clearly illustrated by the author with cross-section diagrams and fabric-cutting layouts.

DC Griffiths has already proved herself dedicated to the job, but there&#39;s another side to her she is less keen to reveal.

October 2006<br><br>Beyond the window, I can see three kites hanging in the air over Bute Park. One blue, one yellow, one pink. Their shapes are precise, as though stenciled. From this distance, I can&#x2019;t see the lines that tether them, so when the kites move, it&#x2019;s as though they&#x2019;re doing so of their own accord. An all-�encompassing sunlight has swallowed depth and shadow.<br><br>I observe all this as I wait for D.C.I. Matthews to finish rearranging the documents on his desk. He shuffles the last file from the stack in front of him to a chair in front of the window. The office is still messy, but at least we can see each other now.<br><br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>I smile.<br><br>He holds up a sheet of paper. The printed side is facing him, but against the light from the window I see the shape of my name at the top. I smile again, not because I feel like smiling but because I can&#x2019;t think of anything sensible to say. This is an interview. My interviewer has my r�sum�. What does he want me to do? Applaud?<br><br>He puts the r�sum� down on the desk in the only empty patch available. He starts to read it through line by line, ticking off each section with his forefinger as he does so.

More like, What exists? What doesn&#x2019;t exist? How do we know whether it exists or not? Things like that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Useful for police work.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not really. I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s useful for anything much, except maybe teaching us to think.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthews is a big man. Not gym-�big, but Welsh-�big, with the sort of comfortable muscularity that suggests a past involving farmwork, rugby, and beer. He has remarkably pale eyes and thick dark hair. Even his fingers have little dark hairs running all the way to the final joints. He is the opposite of me.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you think you have a realistic idea of what police work involves?&#x201d;<br><br>I shrug. I don&#x2019;t know. How are you supposed to know if you haven&#x2019;t done it? I say the sort of thing that I think I&#x2019;m supposed to say. I&#x2019;m interested in law enforcement. I appreciate the value of a disciplined, methodical approach. Blah blah. Yadda yadda. Good little girl in her dark gray interview outfit saying all the things she&#x2019;s supposed to say.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think you might get bored?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bored?&#x201d; I laugh with relief. That&#x2019;s what he was probing at. &#x201c;Maybe. I hope so.

No.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s a short gap, in which he registers surprise and I feel like an idiot. &#x201c;I mean, I want the job. I don&#x2019;t have any questions about that.&#x201d;<br><br>His turn to smile. A real one, not fake ones like mine.<br><br>&#x201c;You do. You really do.&#x201d; He makes that a statement not a question. For a D.C.I., he&#x2019;s not very good at asking questions. I nod anyway.<br><br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;d probably quite like it if I didn&#x2019;t ask you about a two-�year gap in your r�sum�, around the time of your A levels.&#x201d;<br><br>I nod again, more slowly. Yes, I would quite like it if you didn&#x2019;t ask about that.<br><br>&#x201c;Human Resources know what&#x2019;s going on there, do they?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. I&#x2019;ve already been into that with them. I was ill. Then I got better.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who at Human Resources?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Katie.

Instead, he asks who&#x2019;s interviewed me so far. The answer is pretty much everyone. This session with Matthews is the final hurdle.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay. Your father knows you&#x2019;re applying for this job?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He must be pleased.&#x201d;<br><br>Another statement in place of a question. I don&#x2019;t answer it.<br><br>Matthews examines my face intently. Maybe that&#x2019;s his interview technique. Maybe he doesn&#x2019;t ask his suspects any questions, he just makes statements and scrutinizes their faces in the wide-�open light from the big Cardiff sky.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to offer you a job, you know that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course we are. Coppers aren&#x2019;t thick, but you&#x2019;ve got more brains than anyone else in this building. You&#x2019;re healthy. You don&#x2019;t have a criminal record. You were ill for a time as a teenager, but you&#x2019;re fine now. You want to work for us. Why wouldn&#x2019;t we hire you?&#x201d;<br><br>I could think of a couple of possible answers to that, but I don&#x2019;t volunteer them. I&#x2019;m suddenly aware of being intensely relieved, which scares me a bit, because I hadn&#x2019;t been aware of having been anxious. I&#x2019;m standing up. Matthews has stood up too and comes toward me, shaking my hand and saying something. His big shoulders block out my view of Bute Park and the kites. Matthews is talking about formalities and I&#x2019;m blathering answers back at him, but my attention isn&#x2019;t with any of that stuff. I&#x2019;m going to be a policewoman.

Such intrepid adventurers as Wilhelm Filchner, Erich von Drygalski, and Alfred Wegener are not as well known today as Robert Falcon Scott, Roald Amundsen, Ernest Shackleton, Robert E. Peary, or Richard E. Byrd, but their bravery and the hardships they faced were equal to those of the more famous polar explorers.<p></p><p>In the half-century prior to World War II, the poles were the last blank spaces on the global map, and they exerted a tremendous pull on national imaginations. Under successive political regimes, the Germans threw themselves into the race for polar glory with an ardor that matched their better-known counterparts bearing English, American, and Norwegian flags. German polar explorers were driven, like their rivals, by a complex web of interlocking motivations. Personal fame, the romance of the unknown, and the advancement of science were important considerations, but public pressure, political and military concerns, and visions of immense, untapped wealth at the poles also spurred the explorers.</p><p>As historian David Thomas Murphy shows, Germany's repeated encounters with the polar world left an indelible impression upon the German public, government, and scientific community. Reports on the polar landscape, flora, and fauna enhanced Germany's appreciation of the global environment. Accounts of the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, accurate or fantastic, permanently shaped German notions of culture and civilization. The final, failed attempt by the Nazis to extend German political power to the earth's ends revealed the limits of any country's ability to reshape the globe politically or militarily.</p></p><p>David Thomas Murphy is an associate professor of history and political science at Anderson University. He is the author of <i>The Heroic Earth: Geopolitical Thought in Weimar Germany, 1918&#x2013;1933</i>."This is the first comprehensive, analytical account of seven decades of German polar explorations. . . . Amply documented and very well written, the book fills a big gap in the literature."&#x2014;<i>Choice</i> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Throughout his discussions, Murphy displays an enviable ability to vary his scales of scrutiny, ranging seamlessly from the minutiae of hull dimensions, propeller specifications, and expedition provisioning, to the societal contexts of academic and commercial support for exploration. This makes for an exquisite blend. . . . <i>German Exploration of the Polar World: a History, 1870-1940</i> is an attempt to examine polar exploration from a multi-dimensional perspective. In my opinion, it is only this perspective that can make clear the institutional and cultural and scientific fundamentals that have driven high-risk endeavors to the ends of the earth and it is regrettable that so few texts adopt this viewpoint. This book stands as an exemplar of how it should be done.&#x201d;&#x2014;Roger Balm, <i>Terrae Incognitae</i> (Roger Balm <i>Terrae Incognitae</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Murphy&#x2019;s writing is lively, and the fascinating stories of adventure and survival on the ice support his contention that the heroes of German polar endeavors deserve to be known alongside their British, American, and Scandinavian counterparts.&#x201d;&#x2014;Karen Oslund, <i>Isis</i> (Karen Oslund <i>Isis</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Murphy writes a readable, suspenseful story of scientific adventure, the quest for fame, the test of leadership, detailed logical planning, and the physical stamina of those men (never women) who dared to cross deserts and steep mountains of ice and snow under life-threatening conditions of blinding blizzards and unbearably low temperatures. The rich bibliography and the notes show the intensive research that has gone into this study.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The International History Review</i> (<i>The International History Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Murphy&#x2019;s study illustrates that there is much to be gleaned, particularly about the intellectual and social assumptions of the sponsoring nations, from the detailed examination of Arctic and Antarctic exploration.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ken Coates, <i>Canadian Journal of History</i> (Ken Coates <i>Canadian Journal of History</i>)</p><h2>Not That You Asked...</h2><p>Presents more than 120 of the humorist&#39;s most recent and funniest columns on a variety of issues, ranging from politics to the condition of his backyard</p><p>st-loved curmudgeon offers a new collection of pithy insights on whatever happens to be on his mind.The whiny, white-haired leprechaun who dispenses cranky advice on CBS-TV's 60 Minutes as if his bromides about life's minor annoyances are raw pearls of wisdom will entertain his fans with this latest assemblage. Rooney, author of four previous books, has fun with easy targets such as the decline of romance, dull textbooks, the U.S. postal service, the dearth of good conversation, unwanted Christmas gifts and the Miss America contest. He skewers Americans' suspicious stance toward the Soviets ("I never met a Russian as mean and macho as Rambo") and pinpoints the use of sexist language ("No men ever get wed in the New York Times , just women"). Rooney has a knack of talking out of both sides of his mouth when discussing topics such as the arms race, student protest, global eco-catastrophe and the animal rights movement. Ambling from class reunions to credit cards, dogs, cats and the joys of spring in the city, these calculatedly curmudgeonly pieces touch on phenomena with which almost everybody can identify.

Bruno senses a link between the activist groups and the unidentified body, but his investigation is hindered by further attacks on local farms and the interference of local bureaucrats. When Horst disappears under mysterious circumstances, the scope of the case widens, and tension in the town of St-Denis reaches an all-time high.</p><p><em>The Crowded Grave</em> is a sense-stirring portrait of the culture, camaraderie and culinary customs of French country life, accompanied by a satisfying and intoxicating mystery.</p></p><p><p>MARTIN WALKER is the senior director of the Global Business Policy Council as well as editor emeritus and international affairs columnist of United Press International, the global news agency.

The early sun was chasing the mist from the wooded hollows that sheltered the small streams flowing busily down to the River V�z�re. Drops of dew sparkled on the new buds that seemed to have appeared overnight on the bare trees. The air smelled somehow different, fresh and hopeful, and enlivened by the tuneful notes of a dozen different birdsongs. Excited by the change in scents and season, even after his early morning walk through the woods, Gigi the basset hound thrust his nose at the open window of the small police van that descended the steep and curving lane from his master&#x2019;s home. At the wheel, Bruno was singing a half-�remembered song about springtime in Paris. Vaguely thinking of the duties of the day that stretched before him, when rounding the last bend he was suddenly forced to brake.<br><br>For the first time in his memory, the quiet road ahead was blocked with a line of cars and tractors, their engines running and their drivers&#x2019; heads poking from windows. Some were out of their cars, looking at the road that led to St. Denis. Several were talking urgently into cell phones. In the distance a car horn sounded, swiftly joined by others in discordant chorus. As Bruno surveyed the scene his own phone began to ring. He checked the screen, recognized the name of Pierre, a neighbor who lived farther up the road. He ignored it, assuming Pierre would be calling to complain at being stuck in the jam ahead. There had to be an accident of some sort.<br><br>Bruno pushed aside the thought that he could have avoided this delay if he&#x2019;d stayed the night with Pamela, the English-woman he&#x2019;d been seeing since the autumn. She had called off the arrangement that he would dine with her and stay the night, saying she&#x2019;d finally secured an early morning appointment with the <i>mar�chal</i>, the traveling farrier who was to reshoe her horses. Pamela postponed their meetings too frequently for Bruno&#x2019;s comfort, and he was never quite sure whether she was cooling on their relationship or simply wary of commitment. They were to meet again that evening, he reminded himself, without feeling greatly reassured. He parked the van and climbed out to investigate. The best view of the long traffic jam was commanded by Alain, who kept a dairy farm farther up the road to Les Eyzies.<br><br>&#x201c;Geese&#x2014;�the road&#x2019;s full of ducks and geese,&#x201d; he called down to Bruno from his perch high on a tractor. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all over the place.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno heard the sound of rival honking as the geese called back in response to the car horns, and he quickly clambered up beside Alain to peer ahead. The traffic jam stretched as far up the road as he could see. Darting between the stalled cars were perhaps hundreds of ducks and geese, streaming through the woods on the side of the road and heading across it to settle in a broad pond that spread across the meadow, swollen by the spring rains.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Louis Villatte&#x2019;s farm, behind those woods,&#x201d; said Alain. &#x201c;A tree must have come down and broken his fence, let them all escape. There&#x2019;s over three thousand birds in there. Or rather, there used to be. Looks like he&#x2019;s lost a few to the cars too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have you got his number?&#x201d; Bruno asked. Alain nodded. &#x201c;Call him, see if he knows his birds have escaped. Then go through those woods and see if you can help Louis block the gap in his fence. I&#x2019;ll try and sort this out here. Join you later.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno went back to his van, released Gigi, and walked with him down the road, brushing aside the drivers&#x2019; angry queries. A driver he knew was looking mournfully at a broken headlamp while a wounded goose lay half pinned under his car, honking feebly.<br><br>&#x201c;You grew up on a farm, Pierre,&#x201d; Bruno told him, rushing past. &#x201c;Put the poor devil out of its misery.&#x201d; Looking back, he saw Pierre bend to grip the goose behind its head and twist. The bird fluttered wildly and then went limp. Even when the farm boy grew up like Pierre to work in an accountant&#x2019;s office, he hadn&#x2019;t lost the skill.<br><br>When he came to the main grouping of birds, advancing in a jumbled column from the woods, Bruno saw that the road ahead was blocked by some stalled cars coming the other way. He briefly considered using Gigi to turn the birds back, but they would go off and cross the road elsewhere. There was no stopping this exodus, so he might as well try to speed it up and clear the road. He persuaded the leading cars in each queue to reverse a little to make a broader passage to let the birds pass freely across to the pond. Some drivers tried to argue, but he pointed out that the sooner he could stop the supply of ducks, the sooner the road would unblock. He left them grumbling and took Gigi into the trees, trotting past the trail of ducks and geese that was still pottering and waddling its way from the Villatte farm. Bruno smiled to himself, wondering if the birds felt a sense of escape or curiosity, of adventure triggered by the coming of springtime.<br><br>Louis and his wife were already at the huge hole torn in the fence. No tree had fallen, no tractor had ridden through the sturdy barrier of wooden posts and chicken wire that ringed the farm. Instead, whole fence posts had been hauled from the earth and the wire cut. With boards and old doors and cardboard boxes stuffed beneath an ancient tractor, Louis was trying to plug the gaps in the fence. His wife and eldest son were flapping their arms, and their dog was barking to shoo away the ducks and geese following their fellows toward the freedom of the woods.<br><br>Without being told, Gigi darted forward to help drive the birds back from the fence, and Bruno helped Alain to haul some branches from broken trees to seal the remaining gaps in the wire. Once the makeshift barrier was in place, Louis came forward to shake their hands. Gigi and Louis&#x2019;s dog sniffed politely at each other&#x2019;s tails and then sat beside each other, staring at any bird daring to approach.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been at this since daybreak,&#x201d; Louis said. &#x201c;You see how big this gap is? Some bastard ripped this fence down deliberately and did a good job of it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And we know who,&#x201d; added Sandrine, his wife. &#x201c;Look at this, stuck on the bits of the fence they didn&#x2019;t tear down.&#x201d; She handed Bruno a photocopied leaflet, sealed inside a transparent plastic envelope.<br><br>&#x201c;STOP cruelty to animals. Boycott foie gras,&#x201d; he read. There was a smudged photocopied image of a duck held down in a narrow cage. A flexible tube hanging from above was thrust into its mouth by an unidentified man who was stretching the duck&#x2019;s neck taut for the force-�feeding. At the bottom, it read &#x201c;<i>Contactez</i> <i>PETAFrance.com</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s this PETA?&#x201d; asked Alain, peering over Bruno&#x2019;s shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,&#x201d; said Bruno. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an American thing, maybe British, but it&#x2019;s growing in France. They made a big fuss up in Paris about battery chickens and veal, those calves kept in pens. Looks like they&#x2019;ve started running a campaign against foie gras.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s our livelihood,&#x201d; said Sandrine. &#x201c;And we don&#x2019;t make foie gras, we just raise the birds.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And look at this,&#x201d; said Louis. &#x201c;The wire&#x2019;s been cut with proper cutters. This was organized.&#x201d; He showed Bruno the snipped strands of wire. &#x201c;Then they pulled it away somewhere, hiding the stretches of wire they cut. I sent the other boy out looking for it in the woods.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;City bastards,&#x201d; grunted Alain. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know the first thing about the country and they come here like a bunch of terrorists and try to ruin people.&#x201d; He turned aside and spat. &#x201c;You find out who they are, Bruno, and we&#x2019;ll take care of the rest.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno ignored Alain&#x2019;s outrage on behalf of his fellow farmer. &#x201c;All the birds seem to be heading for that pond on the far side of the road,&#x201d; he told Louis. &#x201c;Have you got some way to round them up and bring them back?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll ring the food bell. That brings most of them running. And for the rest, I&#x2019;ve got some netting. That&#x2019;s how we usually round them up. I&#x2019;ll put them in the trailer and bring them back once I&#x2019;ve got this fence fixed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sooner the better, because they&#x2019;ve blocked the whole road into town,&#x201d; said Bruno. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what brought me here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Crazy birds,&#x201d; said Louis, grimacing in rueful affection. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve got a perfectly good pond back in the field, but give them a sniff of someplace new and off they go.&#x201d; He gestured back beyond his house where already some of the ducks, frustrated at their efforts to escape through the newly sealed barrier, were splashing and paddling serenely in their old familiar pond.<br><br>A young boy of about ten labored toward them from the woods, proudly hauling a section of wire fence.<br><br>&#x201c;I found it, Papa,&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;s more. I can show you where.&#x201d; His face broke into a grin at seeing Bruno, who taught him to play rugby in winter and tennis in summer. &#x201c;Bonjour, Monsieur Bruno.&#x201d; He dropped the fence and came forward to shake hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Bonjour, Daniel. Did you see or hear anything when this happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing. The first I heard was when Papa woke us all up to come out and save the birds.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I heard something, a duck call, a single one and then repeated, just before the cockerel started,&#x201d; said Louis. &#x201c;So it must have been a bit before dawn. I remember thinking that&#x2019;s odd, because the ducks don&#x2019;t usually stir until after the hens.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Could it have been a lure, one of those hunter&#x2019;s calls?&#x201d; Bruno asked. &#x201c;Whoever cut the fence must have had some way to wake the birds and tempt them to move. They&#x2019;d have wanted them out before you and the family were awake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It must have been something like that,&#x201d; Sandrine said. &#x201c;The birds tend to stick around the barn, waiting to be fed. They&#x2019;ve never gone off before, even when we had that storm that knocked part of the fence down.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d better get back to the road and see that jam is cleared,&#x201d; said Bruno.<br><br>&#x201c;Before you go, what do you know about this PETA?&#x201d; asked Sandrine.<br><br>&#x201c;Not a lot, but I&#x2019;ll find out,&#x201d; Bruno replied. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ve lost one or two birds to the cars, but not many.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Those birds are worth six euros each to us,&#x201d; said Sandrine. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t afford to lose any of them, what with the bank loan we have to pay until we sell this lot. What if those PETA people come again?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll shoot the bastards,&#x201d; Louis said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll take turns keeping watch, sit up all night if we have to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have a right to protect your property with reasonable force, according to the law,&#x201d; said Bruno. &#x201c;But people interpret &#x2018;reasonable force&#x2019; in different ways. If you hear anything happening again, it&#x2019;s best you call me. Whatever you do, don&#x2019;t use a firearm or any kind of weapon. The best thing is to photograph them so we can identify who they are. If you have any lights you can rig up, or one of those motion detectors . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A camera won&#x2019;t do any good,&#x201d; said Alain. &#x201c;Even with photos the damn courts will take their side. They&#x2019;re all mad Greenies, the magistrates. Then there&#x2019;s those food inspectors and all the other rules and regulations, tying us up in knots.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think I know who it is,&#x201d; said Sandrine. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s those students at the archaeology site who came in last week, working on some dig with that German professor, over toward Campagne. They&#x2019;re all staying at the municipal campground. This time of year, they&#x2019;re the only strangers around here and you know what those students are like. They&#x2019;re all Greens now.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll check it out. See you later.&#x201d; Along the fence he saw the fluttering of another of the leaflets inside a plastic bag, one of the kind that could be sealed and used in freezers. He took out a handkerchief and gingerly removed the pins that held it to the wire. Forensics might get something from it. There were several more attached along the fence and he took another. He nodded at Alain. &#x201c;Do you want to come with me? You&#x2019;ll have to move your tractor.&#x201d;<br><br>As he reached the road, where the jam was steadily clearing itself, Bruno&#x2019;s phone rang again. He checked the screen, saw the name &#x201c;Horst,&#x201d; and this time he answered. Horst Vogelstern was the German professor of archaeology in charge of the student volunteers at the dig. For more than twenty years Horst had spent his vacations at a small house he owned on the outskirts of St. Denis. He ran digs in the V�z�re Valley that the local tourist board liked to proclaim as the cradle of prehistoric man. The first site of Cro-�Magnon man had been found in the valley over a hundred years earlier, and the famous cave paintings of Lascaux were farther up the river. It was a source of pride to Bruno that he lived in this valley that could claim the longest continuous human habitation of anywhere on earth.<br><br>Bruno had attended a couple of Horst&#x2019;s lectures, delivered in excellent if strongly accented French. He had visited his digs and read a couple of articles Horst had published in the popular monthly <i>Dossiers d&#x2019;Arch�ologie</i>. Normally a quiet man, Horst became passionate when he talked of his subject, the great mystery of the replacement of the Neanderthals by the Cro-�Magnons some thirty thousand years ago. Had it been violent? Did they interbreed? Were the Neanderthals wiped out by some plague or disease? It was, said Horst, the crucial question regarding our human origins. Whenever Horst spoke, Bruno caught a sense of the excitement that gripped the scholar.<br><br>&#x201c;Horst,&#x201d; he answered. &#x201c;How are you? I was just on my way to see you at the dig.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good, we need you here right away. And you had better bring a doctor with you. We&#x2019;ve found a body.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Congratulations. Isn&#x2019;t that what you wanted to find?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, yes, but I want skeletons from the distant past. This one is wearing a St. Christopher medal around his neck and I think he&#x2019;s also wearing a Swatch. This is your department, Bruno, not mine.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Tao of Jung: The Way of Integrity</h2><p>A book comparing Carl Jung&#39;s natural world of the psyche to Taoist philosophy explores an integration of opposites--such as shadow/persona, yin/yang, dark/light, feminine/masculine, and the I Ching and synchronicity among others. 25,000 first printing. $20,000 ad/promo.</p><p>David H. Rosen, M.D., holds the only American full professorship in Jungian psychology, at Texas A&amp;M University.Jungian concepts such as archetypes and the collective unconscious have become part of our culture's worldview, just as have some principles of Asian philosophies. So the insights in this book combining the two can be expected to intrigue many of today's readers. Indeed, psychoanalyst Rosen's (Transforming Depression) brief analysis of Jung's life in terms of Taoist principles is more an inspirational work than a biography. Jung became fascinated by Chinese religion and philosophy later in life, he explains. Rosen attempts to illuminate Jung's psychic development in terms of the Chinese concept of crisis, expressed by the pictographs for danger and opportunity. Jung's crisis, in Rosen's view, consisted of his break with Freud, with the pre-Freud and Freudian years represented by danger, the post-break years by opportunity. The text here consists mainly of biographical anecdotes juxtaposed with quotes from the Taoist masters Chuang-tzu and Lao-tzu and selections from the I Ching, some of which are more relevant than others. Rosen's approach works best for Jung's years at Bollinger, where the middle-aged and then the older Jung expressed his deepest understandings in stone carvings as well as in words. At Bollinger, Jung, already steeped in ancient lore, lived the life of a Taoist sage as he "integrated yin and yang forces and became a modest person in harmony with nature." <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bug Watching With Charles Henry Turner (Naturalist&#39;s Apprentice Biographies)</h2><p>Focusses on Charles Henry Turner and his study of insects and their behavior</p><p>Grade 4-6?Ross profiles two remarkable scientists who succeeded in their fields despite the racial and gender prejudices of the early 20th century. Turner, one of the few African Americans in his day to earn a doctorate (in zoology) was noted for his research on insect behavior. Eastwood was a self-taught botanist in an era when science was considered an inappropriate pursuit for women. She gained renown for her intrepid explorations of remote areas of Colorado and California, where she collected and identified plants, and for her books on the flora of these regions. A mix of assorted black-and-white reproductions and watercolor paintings of flora and fauna appear on about every other page. Many of the photos are not dated. For the most part, the texts are competently written; however, some information is oversimplified. For instance, the text of Bug Watching consistently uses the unscientific term "bug" instead of the correct terms, "insect" or "spider," even after the correct terms are defined. Use of such imprecise terms does not match the predominantly straightforward text. Scientific miscellanea is juxtaposed with the main texts in beige-colored inserts designed to look like torn pages from an old notebook. The majority of them are only marginally relevant. Neither of these books attempts to be a definitive biography of its subject (both scientists appear to be near saints in character), but rather to provide overviews of their lives and accomplishments. Flower Watching will be the more useful title as it is more clearly written.?Karey Wehner, San Francisco Public Library<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.A well-researched biography of a lesser-known scientist, complete with project ideas that extend the book's usefulness. In the same format as Flower Watching (p. 1712), this entry in the Naturalist's Apprentice series combines biographical information--this time on the life and work of entomologist Charles Henry Turner (18671823)--with tips and activities, all expertly illustrated by Caple. Turner's story is one of overcoming obstacles and prejudices as the only African-American in his college class, the first to serve on the faculty of his university, and the first to be elected a member of the St. Louis Academy of Science. Genuinely inspiring are the details of Turner's experiments on the web-building instinct and intelligence of spiders, the homing of ants, the color-blindness of bees. Charts, mazes, and diagrams shed light on Turner's approach as well as provide clear directions on how to replicate insect experiments, along with a list of supplies needed. Insect enthusiasts can investigate whether bees can tell time by setting up a flower schedule and can test the learning abilities of cockroaches and caterpillars by observing them in a maze constructed of building blocks. Bugs are distinguished from insects at the outset, and precise drawings and insets offer background information on the specific subjects of Turner's studies.

If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be... Nelly, I <i>am</i> Heathcliff!

In a primitive studio next to the railroad tracks, many of America&#39;s earliest jazz, blues, and country musicians were captured on wax discs. It was here that Hoagy Carmichael&#39;s timeless &#34;&#34;Stardust&#34;&#34; debuted as a dance stomp. In 1915, the Gennett family, the enterprising owners of Starr Piano Company, created a small record division to supplement their income. In the early 1920s Gennett&#39;s victory in a landmark patent case involving the mighty Victor Records changed the competitive nature of the young record industry. The Gennetts made music history by recording young jazz pioneers in the Midwest and folk musicians from the Appalachian hills at a time when major record labels in the East couldn&#39;t be bothered. Gennett featured such country music stars (then known as &#34;&#34;old-time&#34;&#34; musicians) as Gene Autry, Chubby Parker, and Bradley Kincaid and early blues artists Big Bill Broonzy, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and Roosevelt Sykes. During a period of rigid segregation, Gennett freely recorded black musicians. Ultimately issuing discs with several different labels, Gennett had a major impact, particularly on the emerging jazz movement, both in the United States and abroad. Today these recordings are valued collector&#39;s items, and some have been reissued in anthologies on LP and CD. Jelly Roll, Bix, and Hoagy is the first detailed account of the people and events behind this unique company. Personalized by anecdotes from musicians, employees, and family members, it traces the colorful history of this innovative business until its demise during the Great Depression. As Steve Allen predicts in the Foreword, &#34;&#34;even those with no special involvement with jazz will be stimulated by the combination of the many cultural and social threads the book weaves together.&#34;&#34;<p>RICK KENNEDY is a media relations manager with General Electric Company.

Like his most famous work, her father was a study in contradictions: eccentric, brilliant, and voracious, but also mercurial, competitive, and stubborn, with a love of mischief that sometimes cut too close to the bone. Being raised by such a larger than- life personality could be claustrophobic, even at the sprawling Upper West Side apartments of the Apthorp, which the Hellers called home&#x2014;in one way or another&#x2014;for forty-five years. <br><br><i>Yossarian Slept Here </i>is Erica Heller&#x2019;s wickedly funny but also poignant and incisive memoir about growing up in a family&#x2014;her iconic father; her wry, beautiful mother, Shirley; her younger brother, Ted; her relentlessly inventive grandmother Dottie&#x2014;that could be by turns caring, infuriating, and exasperating, though anything but dull. From the forbidden pleasures of ordering shrimp cocktail when it was beyond the family&#x2019;s budget to spending a summer, as her father&#x2019;s fame grew, at the Beverly Hills Hotel, Erica details the Hellers&#x2019; charmed&#x2014;and charmingly turbulent&#x2014; trajectory. She offers a rare glimpse of meetings with the Gourmet Club, where her father would dine weekly with Mel Brooks, Zero Mostel, and Mario Puzo, among others (and from which all wives and children were strictly verboten). She introduces us to many extraordinary residents of the Apthorp, some famous&#x2014;George Balanchine, Sidney Poitier, and Lena Horne, to name a few&#x2014;and some not famous, but all quite memorable. Yet she also manages to limn the complex bonds of loyalty and guilt, hurt and healing, that define every family. Erica was among those present at her father&#x2019;s bedside as he struggled to recover from Guillain-Barr� syndrome and then cared for her mother when Shirley was diagnosed with terminal cancer after the thirty-eight-year marriage and intensely passionate partnership with Joe had ended. <br><br>Witty and perceptive, and displaying the descriptive gifts of a born storyteller, this authentic and colorful portrait of life in the Heller household unfolds alongside the saga of the family&#x2019;s moves into four distinctive apartments within the Apthorp, each representing a different phase of their lives together&#x2014;and apart. It is a story about achieving a dream; about fame and its aftermath; about lasting love, squandered opportunities, and how to have the best meal in Chinatown.</p><p>Erica Heller is the daughter of Joseph Heller, author of Catch-22. An advertising copywriter, novelist and creative consultant, her work has appeared in the New York Observer and on The Huffington Post. She lives in New York.<i>A Jewish wife will forgive and forget, but she&#x2019;ll never forget what she forgave.</i> <br> <br>&#x2014;Jewish proverb<br> <br> <b>INTRODUCTION</b> <br> <br>&#x201c;Joe <i>who</i>?&#x201d; my mother asked without guile from her hospital bed. She&#x2019;d just read a card that had been tucked into a glorious bouquet of freshly delivered flowers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Joe <i>Heller</i>,&#x201d; I told her. I was flabbergasted that she didn&#x2019;t know or couldn&#x2019;t guess, but then we were in Sloan-Kettering. It was 1995, she was dying, and although my parents had been married for thirty-eight years, they had had a particularly acrimonious divorce twelve years before and had not spoken since. So perhaps the fact that she was scouring her brain for non-Hellerian Joes she might know was not really all that startling. I reached over for the card and read aloud: &#x201c;My darling Shirley,&#x201d; it began, &#x201c;I am so sorry. Joe.&#x201d; I handed it back to her.<br> <br>When I told her who&#x2019;d sent the flowers, she spoke slowly and without rancor. &#x201c;Well, he <i>is</i> a sorry soul,&#x201d; she pronounced wearily, crumpling up the card and dropping it into the yellow plastic trash bin on the floor beside her bed. &#x201c;But he sent you flowers,&#x201d; I pushed, somehow hoping for more. &#x201c;Th ey&#x2019;re from <i>Dad.</i> Don&#x2019;t you think they&#x2019;re nice?&#x201d; I pestered, leading the witness. She stared at me, unruffled and unimpressed. &#x201c;I get it. I understand,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But really, how wildly would you like me to celebrate this? Should I hire jugglers?&#x201d; Then she muttered something that I made her repeat twice because it was said so faintly, she closed her eyes and we never spoke of the flowers or of my father again.<br> <br>By then my mother was bald and terribly frail. After her initial diagnosis a year and a half earlier, I&#x2019;d moved back in with her at the Apthorp, the apartment building where I&#x2019;d grown up, decamping from the Upper East Side to properly care for her for as long as was needed.<br> <br>From the day I moved back in, whether my mother was home or, as she was with increasing frequency, in the hospital, my father was too stubborn and too shaken by the gravity of her illness to call or speak to her. Instead, he called me. Night after night he inquired about her with an array of questions that never varied: Had she eaten? Had she gotten fresh air that day? Was she able to sleep? What were the doctors saying? Had she taken all of her medications and had I remembered to give her all of her vitamins? What was her mood? Every night I answered him, increasingly baffled by his persistent interest and concern, but not, I suspect, as baffled as he himself may have been.<br> <br>As my mother got sicker, had brain surgery, lung surgery, chemo, and radiation, I could hear how much more difficult it was for him to keep the fear from creeping into his voice. He knew we were going to lose her. It was only a question of when. Officially, they had lost each other many years before, of course, but it was obvious how deeply he was tied to her. They were still uncannily connected.<br> <br>Even after years of silence, the truth remained that there&#x2019;d never been anyone who&#x2019;d known or understood each of them better than the other. There never would be. With Mom&#x2019;s death, this aspect of my father&#x2019;s life would be obliterated, and I sensed that fact very strongly during that time. To me, it could easily be seen lurking just beneath the surface&#x2014;a surface customarily guarded and closed and, for the most part, ineluctably indecipherable.<br> <br>When my father called me those nights he was not the blustery, famous author; the gruff, arrogant big shot; the smug, cocky fellow who sometimes showed up to friends&#x2019; cocktail parties for the sheer fun of insulting them. He wasn&#x2019;t the caustic, clever master of the verbal arabesque who for years had answered the question &#x201c;How come you&#x2019;ve never written a book as good as <i>Catch-22</i>?&#x201d; with the sly, Talmudic response to put any other to shame: &#x201c;Who <i>has</i>?&#x201d; he&#x2019;d ask, genuinely wanting to know. He was not bombastic or self-satisfied during those nightly calls. He was only sad. He just wanted to talk, and I let him.<br> <br>Then, about a month before my mother died, when she had gone into Sloan-Kettering for what seemed as if it might be the last time, one night when Dad called I was simply too exhausted to hold everything back that I&#x2019;d been wanting to say to him ever since she&#x2019;d first been diagnosed. I had never found the courage or the proper words to use with him before.<br> <br>I blurted out that he simply had to communicate with her again <i>now</i>, or he would never forgive himself. &#x201c;How will you live with yourself if you don&#x2019;t? How will you sleep at night?&#x201d; I asked in an uncustomarily loud tone. He listened silently, and I could picture him sitting in his lemon-yellow study out in East Hampton where he lived, seething at the very notion of being scolded by his daughter. &#x201c;Call. Write to her. Send flowers. Do <i>something.</i> There isn&#x2019;t much time left, and if you don&#x2019;t, I think you&#x2019;ll always be sorry,&#x201d; I fumbled, suddenly aware of and horrified by my own stridence. Now, understandably, there was angry silence. When Dad finally spoke, he was petulant, childlike. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need <i>you</i> to tell me what to do,&#x201d; he growled, hanging up before I could respond.<br> <br>It was the very next day when, sitting in my mother&#x2019;s hospital room, there had been a knock at the door, and an orderly had entered with the exquisite bouquet of flowers for Mom. From Dad.<br> <br>When I arrived home that night the phone was already ringing. He wanted to know if she&#x2019;d gotten the flowers and if so, had she liked them. I assured him that they&#x2019;d arrived and had been magnificent. &#x201c;Well, what did she say?&#x201d; he asked with some urgency, and then it was my turn to be silent.<br> <br>After the divorce, for years my father had begged, cajoled, and finally actually offered me a hefty bribe of ten thousand dollars in cash if I would only tell him my mother&#x2019;s secret pot roast recipe. It was handed down to her from her mother, my grandmother Dottie, and the meal was for him like kryptonite. It always made him groggy, feeble, and positively stupid with glee, turning his knees to jelly.<br> <br>When my mother had closed her eyes in the hospital after receiving his flowers, what she had muttered to me, in fact, was: &#x201c;No matter what, don&#x2019;t <i>ever</i> give him the pot roast recipe,&#x201d; and with that, she&#x2019;d drifted off to sleep. I did not share this with him, take a sorrowful moment when he was so uncharacteristically humbled and vulnerable and make it even more difficult.<br> <br>On the other hand, he never did get that recipe.<br> <br>� 2011 Erica Heller</p><h2>Home Life in Colonial Days (Dover Books on Americana)</h2><p>Could you identify a sausage gun if you had to? How about a plate warmer or a well-sweep? Any idea how the term log-rolling <i>really</i> originated? Alice Morse Earle (1851&#x2013;1911), a prolific popular historian and the first American to chronicle everyday life and customs of the colonial era, describes what these and many other obscure utensils were and how they were used. She also conveys a vivid picture of home production of textiles, colonial dress, transportation, religious and social practices, the care of flower gardens, colonial neighborliness, and other aspects of early American life.<br>Widely read when it was first published in 1898, this fascinating and wonderfully readable guide was instrumental in promoting a renewed interest in everyday life of bygone times. Today, it offers history buffs, collectors, and other interested readers a feast of delightful information.</p><p><p>"When the first settlers landed on American shores, the difficulties in finding or making shelter must have seemed ironical as well as almost unbearable. The colonists found a land magnificent with forest trees of every size and variety, but they had no sawmills, and few saws to cut boards; there was plenty of clay and ample limestone on every side, yet they could have no brick and no mortar; grand boulders of granite and rock were everywhere, yet there was not a single facility for cutting, drawing, or using stone. These homeless men, so sorely in need of immediate shelter, were baffled by pioneer conditions, and had to turn to many poor expedients and be satisfied with rude covering. In Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, and, possibly, other states, some reverted to an ancient form of shelter: they became cave-dwellers; caves were dug in the side of a hill and lived in till the settlers could have time to chop down and cut up trees for log houses."<br>--from Chapter I</p><p>In this comprehensive study on the way of life of the early settlers in the New World, Alice Morse Earle accurately details the new experiences of the colonists and the daily struggles and problems they faced.</p><p>Once the settlers built homes, they were met with such problems as providing lighting and preparing and storing food.

Original.</p><p><p>THOMAS H. COOK held several jobs as teacher and book reviewer before he began writing full-time. Many of his novels have been nominated for the Edgar and other prestigious awards. He won the Edgar for <i>The Chatham School Affair</i>.</p>Alternately horrifying and deeply moving, this fast-paced true-crime report by Cook (Early Graves, The City When It Rains- -both 1990, etc.) focuses on the murder of six members of the Alday family of rural Seminole County, Georgia, on May 14, 1973. The slaughter was the work of three brothers--Carl and Billy Isaacs and Wayne Coleman--and of a slow-witted black man, George Dungee. The quartet were on the lam from Baltimore, where Carl, Wayne, and George had recently escaped from prison. Billy, the youngest, was along for the excitement. Spotting the trailer home of Jerry and Mary Alday, the four men, short on cash, pulled into the yard and began rifling the place. In the midst of the burglary, Jerry and his father arrived home and were promptly shot to death. A while later, other family members arrived: each was murdered. The last to appear was Mary, who was killed after being raped repeatedly. Then the murderers took off in her car and began roaming the South, staging holdups and stealing cars. Eventually arrested in West Virginia, they were returned to Georgia to stand trial. Billy turned state's evidence, and the three others were given death penalties--but the sentences were appealed, with two overturned. Today, a totally unrepentant Carl is apparently still manipulating the system and issuing statements such as, ``What did [the victims] ever do? No one would have ever paid any attention to them, if I hadn't come along and killed them.'' In Cook's capable hands, the cumulative effect is shattering. And when the author writes of the sufferings of surviving Alday family members--the loss of their farm, or their reliving of the tragic events with each new judicial maneuver--his words prove sensitive and resonant. An immensely involving work that shifts from the repellent to the heartwarming and back and asks important questions about the clash between criminals' and victims' rights.

They continue south, but soon are stranded at the Cypress House--an isolated Gulf Coast boarding house run by the beautiful Rebecca Cady--directly in the path of an approaching hurricane.<br><br>The storm isn't the only approaching danger, though. A much deadlier force controls the county and everyone living in it, and Arlen wants out--fast. But Paul refuses to abandon Rebecca to face the threats alone, even though Arlen's eerie gift warns that if they stay too long they may never leave. From its chilling beginning to terrifying end, <i>The Cypress House </i>is a story of relentless suspense from "one of the best of the best" (Michael Connelly).</p><p><b>Michael Koryta</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of fourteen novels, most recently <i>If She Wakes</i>.

Bush and the Bush Family Dynasty</h2><p>In one of the most unprecedented developments in the history of national politics, George W. Bush abruptly emerged to lead all presidential aspirants in the national polls for the 2000 election. Yet voters know very little about the man, beyond his famous name and his place in one of the nation's most powerful political dynasties.<br><br><b>First Son</b> is a true, riveting family saga about extraordinary power and politics in America and in the unharnessed state--a state of mind--called Texas. The story begins with the turn-of-the-century emergence of the influential Bush-Walker clan and of Prescott Bush, the Connecticut patrician who ingrained in his family an ethos that continues to exert influence on his son, former President George Bush, and his grandsons, George W. and Jeb. How these scions of the Bush dynasty struggle to live up to their enduring legacy is the central theme of this colorful and perceptive portrait the first authentative book on the governor of Texas.<br><br>In the past year, award-winning Texas writer Bill Minutaglio has met with George W. Bush and interviewed dozens of people close to him, from his brother Governor Jeb Bush of Florida to uncles and cousins, from current and former political advisers to high-ranking insiders from his father's years in the White House. Fraternity buddies, political operatives, George W.'s employers, and even ardent critics of the Bush family bring this story to life--from the society circles in his native Connecticut to the family compound in Maine to the backwaters of his adopted Texas. The result is a book that is nuanced, insightful, and surprising in the contradictions and complexities it reveals about this man.<br><br><b>First Son</b> vividly reconstructs George W. Bush's boarding-school days at one of the country's most exclusive institutions; his tenure in one of Yale's secret societies and as president of his unfettered fraternity; his attempts to follow his family's million-dollar path into the wide-open Texas oil patch; his role in major league baseball as the public face and head cheerleader for the Texas Rangers; and, finally, his rise to governor of Texas and national political force, executed with more hard-edged calculation than many people realize.<br><br>Written with precision, verve, and fair-minded balanace, <b>First Son</b> will be the political story of 2000--the eye-opening tale of a natural-born politician.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>The first of several Y2K biographies on Texas governor George W. Bush offers an in-depth look at both the Republican presidential candidate and his political family: Bill Minutaglio interviewed more than 300 people for <i>First Son</i>, including Bush and many members of his inner circle. The book focuses on the life of "Dubya" (the nickname used by the press and others to distinguish him from his father) and includes a combination of original material and information that has been reported elsewhere. It is neither pro- nor anti-Bush, simply reportorial and largely nonjudgmental. Readers won't find an answer to one of the season's most burning questions: Has Bush ever used illegal drugs? In a preface, Minutaglio piously says he won't stoop to such low levels. Yet one gets the sense that he won't go there because he doesn't have any hard evidence, as stories of Bush's heavy drinking are related without apparent reservation. Minutaglio, a writer for <i>The Dallas Morning News</i>, spends most of his time describing Bush's amazing and unexpected rise to fame. Dubya's own family, for instance, thought that younger brother Jeb would be the first to win an important public office. Yet Dubya exploited his family ties and personal charisma to have a successful business career in the 1980s and then beat a popular incumbent in 1994 to become Texas governor. (Jeb became governor of Florida in 1998, while his brother won a second term in Austin.) Minutaglio's narrative goes light on Bush's gubernatorial record and ends before his formal entry into the presidential race in 1999. Readers hungry for an overview of the man who would be president, however, could do much worse than start by looking here. <i>--John J. Miller</i>"A must-read . . . a fascinating personality portrait of an ambitious, ornery, and intensely competitive man." <br>-- Business Week<br><br>"With a style reminiscent of Tom Wolfe and Richard Ben Cramer -- even Hunter Thompson (without the gonzo quotient), Bill Minutaglio takes the reader on a romp through Texas politics, through a dynasty not quite competitive with the Kennedys. . . . The reader may be a bit breathless but never bored." <br>-- C. Frasier Smith, Baltimore Sun<br><br>"First Son is one of those very rare nonfiction books that capture the trifecta -- wonderfully readable, impeccably reported, and revealing. Bill Minutaglio has captured that insane and marvelous state of mind called Texas. He has also captured the ups and downs of what it is like to grow up in the shadow of a very, very famous father." <br>-- Buzz Bissinger, author of Friday Night Lights and A Prayer for the City<br><br>"The book will be a dog-eared reference for politicos and journalists and anyone else who wants to study the low-key, discreet Republican version of an American political dynasty. Minutaglio captures the Machiavellian maneuvers of Washington political aides and the wacky, often hardball antics of Texas politics with dead-on accuracy."<br>-- Wendy Benjaminson, Houston Chronicle<br><br>"Bill Minutaglio places his subject solidly in the context of his family -- and that is the right place to start figuring out who and what George W. is. . . . Minutaglio demonstrates more fully than anyone else I have read, literally everything in Bush's resume up to his election as governor was to a substantial degree handed to him. . . . I could discern no evident bias -- either adulatory or cynical. And there are some important clues to the character of a second Bush presidency." <br>-- David Broder, Washington Monthly<br><br>"First Son is fair, balanced, interesting, and well-written.

Each evening, sipping his Scotch and lemon, Mr. Mulliner tells of an adventure that once befell a nephew, a cousin&#x2019;s son, or some other un-stuffy younger relative. Mr. Mulliner&#x2019;s narratives showcase Wodehouse&#x2019;s particular genius for fetching whimsy and eccenric shenanigans.</p><p>P.G. Wodehouse published over ninety books in his seventy-year career. Born in in 1881 in Surrey, England, he came a U.S. citizen in 1955. He died at the age of 93 in 1975.1<br><br>THE SMILE THAT WINS<br><br>The conversation in the bar-parlour of the Angler's Rest had turned to the subject of the regrettably low standard of morality prevalent among the nobility and landed gentry of Great Britain.<br><br>Miss Postlethwaite, our erudite barmaid, had brought the matter up by mentioning that in the novelette which she was reading a viscount had just thrown a family solicitor over a cliff.<br><br>'Because he had found out his guilty secret,' explained Miss Postlethwaite, polishing a glass a little severely, for she was a good woman. 'It was his guilty secret this solicitor had found out, so the viscount threw him over a cliff. I suppose, if one did but know, that sort of thing is going on all the time.'<br><br>Mr Mulliner nodded gravely.<br><br>'So much so,' he agreed, 'that I believe that whenever a family solicitor is found in two or more pieces at the bottom of a cliff, the first thing the Big Four at Scotland Yard do is make a roundup of all the viscounts in the neighbourhood.'<br><br>'Baronets are worse than viscounts,' said a Pint of Stout vehemently. 'I was done down by one only last month over the sale of a cow.'<br><br>'Earls are worse than baronets,' insisted a Whisky Sour. 'I could tell you something about earls.'<br><br>'How about O.B.E.s?' demanded a Mild and Bitter. 'If you ask me, O.B.E.s want watching, too.'<br><br>Mr Mulliner sighed.<br><br>'The fact is,' he said, 'reluctant though one may be to admit it, the entire British aristocracy is seamed and honeycombed with immorality. I venture to assert that, if you took a pin and jabbed it down anywhere in the pages of <i>Debrett's Peerage</i>, you would find it piercing the name of someone who was going about the place with a conscience as tender as a sunburned neck. If anything were needed to prove my assertion, the story of my nephew, Adrian Mulliner, the detective, would do it.'<br><br>'I didn't know you had a nephew who was a detective,' said the Whisky Sour.<br>Oh, yes. He has retired now, but at one time he was as keen an operator as anyone in the profession (said Mr Mulliner). After leaving Oxford and trying his hand at one or two uncongenial tasks, he had found his niche as a member of the firm of Widgery and Boon, Investigators, of Albemarle Street. And it was during his second year with this old-established house that he met and loved Lady Millicent Shipton-Bellinger, younger daughter of the fifth Earl of Brangbolton.<br><br>It was the Adventure of the Missing Sealyham that brought the young couple together. From the purely professional standpoint, my nephew has never ranked this among his greatest triumphs of ratiocination; but, considering what it led to, he might well, I think, be justified in regarding it as the most important case of his career. What happened was that he met the animal straying in the park, deduced from the name and address on its collar that it belonged to Lady Millicent Shipton-Bellinger, of 18a, Upper Brook Street, and took it thither at the conclusion of his stroll and restored it.<br><br>'Child's-play' is the phrase with which, if you happen to allude to it, Adrian Mulliner will always airily dismiss this particular investigation; but Lady Millicent could not have displayed more admiration and enthusiasm had it been the supremest masterpiece of detective work. She fawned on my nephew. She invited him in to tea, consisting of buttered toast, anchovy sandwiches and two kinds of cake; and at the conclusion of the meal they parted on terms which, even at that early stage in their acquaintance, were something warmer than those of mere friendship.<br><br>Indeed, it is my belief that the girl fell in love with Adrian as instantaneously as he with her. On him, it was her radiant blonde beauty that exercised the spell. She, on her side, was fascinated, I fancy, not only by the regularity of his features, which, as is the case with all the Mulliners, was considerable, but also by the fact that he was dark and thin and wore an air of inscrutable melancholy.<br><br>This, as a matter of fact, was due to the troublesome attacks of dyspepsia from which he had suffered since boyhood; but to the girl it naturally seemed evidence of a great and romantic soul. Nobody, she felt, could look so grave and sad, had he not hidden deeps in him.<br><br>One can see the thing from her point of view. All her life she had been accustomed to brainless juveniles who eked out their meagre eyesight with monocles and, as far as conversation was concerned, were a spent force after they had asked her if she had seen the Academy or did she think she would prefer a glass of lemonade. The effect on her of a dark, keen-eyed man like Adrian Mulliner, who spoke well and easily of footprints, psychology and the underworld, must have been stupendous.<br><br>At any rate, their love ripened rapidly. It could not have been two weeks after their first meeting when Adrian, as he was giving her lunch one day at the Senior Bloodstain, the detectives' club in Rupert Street, proposed and was accepted. And for the next twenty-four hours, one is safe in saying, there was in the whole of London, including the outlying suburban districts, no happier private investigator than he.<br><br>Next day, however, when he again met Millicent for lunch, he was disturbed to perceive on her beautiful face an emotion which his trained eye immediately recognized as anguish.<br><br>'Oh, Adrian,' said the girl brokenly. 'The worst has happened. My father refuses to hear of our marrying. When I told him we were engaged, he said "Pooh!" quite a number of times, and added that he had never heard such dashed nonsense in his life. You see, ever since my Uncle Joe's trouble in nineteen-twenty-eight, father has had a horror of detectives.'<br><br>'I don't think I have met your Uncle Joe.'<br><br>'You will have the opportunity next year. With the usual allowance for good conduct he should be with us again about July. And there is another thing.'<br><br>'Not another?'<br><br>'Yes. Do you know Sir Jasper Addleton, O.B.E.?'<br><br>'The financier?'<br><br>'Father wants me to marry him. Isn't it awful!'<br><br>'I have certainly heard more enjoyable bits of news,' agreed Adrian. 'This wants a good deal of careful thinking over.'<br><br>The process of thinking over his unfortunate situation had the effect of rendering excessively acute the pangs of Adrian Mulliner's dyspepsia. During the past two weeks the ecstasy of being with Millicent and deducing that she loved him had caused a complete cessation of the attacks; but now they began again, worse than ever. At length, after a sleepless night during which he experienced all the emotions of one who has carelessly swallowed a family of scorpions, he sought a specialist.<br><br>The specialist was one of those keen, modern minds who disdain the outworn formul� of the more conservative mass of the medical profession. He examined Adrian carefully, then sat back in his chair, with the tips of his fingers touching.<br><br>'Smile!' he said.<br><br>'Eh?' said Adrian.<br><br>'Smile, Mr Mulliner.'<br><br>'Did you say smile?'<br><br>'That's it. Smile.'<br><br>'But,' Adrian pointed out, 'I've just lost the only girl I ever loved.'<br><br>'Well, that's fine,' said the specialist, who was a bachelor. 'Come on, now, if you please. Start smiling.'<br><br>Adrian was a little bewildered. 'Listen,' he said. 'What <i>is</i> all this about smiling? We started, if I recollect, talking about my gastric juices. Now, in some mysterious way, we seem to have got on to the subject of smiles. How do you mean -- smile? I never smile. I haven't smiled since the butler tripped over the spaniel and upset the melted butter on my Aunt Elizabeth, when I was a boy of twelve.'<br><br>The specialist nodded.<br><br>'Precisely. And that is why your digestive organs trouble you. Dyspepsia,' he proceeded, 'is now recognized by the progressive element of the profession as purely mental. We do not treat it with drugs and medicines. Happiness is the only cure. Be gay, Mr Mulliner. Be cheerful. And, if you can't do that, at any rate smile. The mere exercise of the risible muscles is in itself beneficial. Go out now and make a point, whenever you have a spare moment, of smiling.'<br><br>'Like this?' said Adrian.<br><br>'Wider than that.'<br><br>'How about this?'<br><br>'Better,' said the specialist, 'but still not quite so elastic as one could desire. Naturally, you need practice. We must expect the muscles to work rustily for a while at their unaccustomed task. No doubt things will brighten by and by.'<br><br>He regarded Adrian thoughtfully.<br><br>'Odd,' he said. 'A curious smile, yours, Mr Mulliner. It reminds me a little of the Mona Lisa's. It has the same underlying note of the sardonic and the sinister. It virtually amounts to a leer. Somehow it seems to convey the suggestion that you know all. Fortunately, my own life is an open book, for all to read, and so I was not discommoded. But I think it would be better if, for the present, you endeavoured not to smile at invalids or nervous persons. Good morning, Mr Mulliner. That will be five guineas, precisely.'<br>On Adrian's face, as he went off that afternoon to perform the duties assigned to him by his firm, there was no smile of any description. He shrank from the ordeal before him. He had been told off to guard the wedding-presents at a reception in Grosvenor Square, and naturally anything to do with weddings was like a sword through his heart. His face, as he patrolled the room where the gifts were laid out, was drawn and forbidding. Hitherto, at these functions, it had always been his pride that nobody could tell that he was a detective. To-day, a child could have recognized his trade. He looked like Sherlock Holmes.<br><br>To the gay throng that surged about him he paid little attention. Usually tense and alert on occasions like this, he now found his mind wandering. He mused sadly on Millicent. And suddenly -- the result, no doubt, of these gloomy meditations, though a glass of wedding champagne may have contributed its mite -- there shot through him, starting at about the third button of his neat waistcoat, a pang ...</p><h2>Death of an Unsung Hero: A Lady Montfort Mystery (Lady Montfort Mystery Series, 4)</h2><p><p>In 1916, the world is at war and the energetic Lady Montfort has persuaded her husband to offer his family&#x2019;s dower house to the War Office as an auxiliary hospital for officers recovering from shell-shock with their redoubtable housekeeper Mrs. Jackson contributing to the war effort as the hospital&#x2019;s quartermaster.</p><p>Despite the hospital&#x2019;s success, the farming community of Haversham, led by the Montfort&#x2019;s neighbor Sir Winchell Meacham, does not approve of a country-house hospital for men they consider to be cowards.

What Bella doesn&#39;t realise is the closer she gets to him, the more she is putting herself and those around her at risk. And it might be too late to turn back...

'Be very still,' he whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen. Slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. Then abruptly, but very gently, he rested his cold cheek against the hollow at the base of my throat." <p> As Shakespeare knew, love burns high when thwarted by obstacles. In <i>Twilight</i>, an exquisite fantasy by Stephenie Meyer, readers discover a pair of lovers who are supremely star-crossed. Bella adores beautiful Edward, and he returns her love. But Edward is having a hard time controlling the blood lust she arouses in him, because--he's a vampire. At any moment, the intensity of their passion could drive him to kill her, and he agonizes over the danger. But, Bella would rather be dead than part from Edward, so she risks her life to stay near him, and the novel burns with the erotic tension of their dangerous and necessarily chaste relationship.</p><p> Meyer has achieved quite a feat by making this scenario completely human and believable. She begins with a familiar YA premise (the new kid in school), and lulls us into thinking this will be just another realistic young adult novel. Bella has come to the small town of Forks on the gloomy Olympic Peninsula to be with her father. At school, she wonders about a group of five remarkably beautiful teens, who sit together in the cafeteria but never eat. As she grows to know, and then love, Edward, she learns their secret. They are all rescued vampires, part of a family headed by saintly Carlisle, who has inspired them to renounce human prey. For Edward's sake they welcome Bella, but when a roving group of tracker vampires fixates on her, the family is drawn into a desperate pursuit to protect the fragile human in their midst. The precision and delicacy of Meyer's writing lifts this wonderful novel beyond the limitations of the horror genre to a place among the best of YA fiction.

What are you watching now that those shows are off the air?<br> <b>A:</b> I have never seen an entire episode of <i>Buffy</i> or <i>Angel</i>. While I was writing <i>Twilight</i>, I let my older sister read along chapter by chapter. She's a huge Buffy fan and she kept trying to get me to watch, but I was afraid it would mess up my vision of the vampire world so I never did.<p> I don't have a ton of time for TV, and my kids get rowdy when I have on "mommy shows," but I do have a secret fondness for reality shows (the good ones, at least in my opinion). I always TiVo <i>Survivor</i>, <i>The Amazing Race</i>, and <i>America's Next Top Model</i>.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> What inspired you to write <i>Twilight</i>? Is this the beginning of a series? Why write for teens?<br> <b>A:</b> <i>Twilight</i> was inspired by a very vivid dream, which is fairly faithfully transcribed as chapter thirteen of the book. There are sequels on the way--I'm hard at work editing book two (tentatively titled <i>New Moon</i>) right now, and book three is waiting in line for its turn.<br> I didn't mean to write for teens--I didn't mean to write for anyone but myself, so I had an audience of one twenty-nine year old (and later one thirty-one year old when my sister started reading). I think the reason that I ended up with a book for teens is because high school is such a compelling time period--it gives you some of your worst scars and some of your most exhilarating memories. It's a fascinating place: old enough to feel truly adult, old enough to make decisions that affect the rest of your life, old enough to fall in love, yet, at the same time too young (in most cases) to be free to make a lot of those decisions without someone else's approval. There's a lot of scope for a novel in that.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> What is your favorite vampire story? Fave vampire movie?<br> <b>A:</b> I guess my favorite vampire story would be <i>The Vampire Lestat</i>, by Anne Rice, simply because it's one of the only ones I've ever read. I keep meaning to pick up Bram Stoker's <i>Dracula</i>, because I get asked this question so often and I should probably start with the classics, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. Again, I'm afraid to read other vampire books now, for fear of finding things either too similar, or too different from my own vampire world.</p><p> Ack! I can't even answer the movie question. I can't remember ever seeing a single vampire movie, outside of clips from Bela Lugosi movies on TV. I don't like true horror movies--my favorite scary movies are all Hitchcock's.<br><br> <b>Q:</b> What other young adult authors do you read?<br> <b>A:</b> My favorite young adult author is L.M. Montgomery I also enjoy J.K. Rowling (but who doesn't?), and Ann Brashares. As a teen, I skipped straight to adult books (lots of sci-fi and Jane Austen), so I'm rediscovering the world of teen literature now.<br><br></p> <p> <strong>Stephenie Meyer's List of Books You Should Read</strong> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr> <td> <br><i>Anne of Green Gables</i></td><td> <br><i>Romeo and Juliet</i></td><td> <br><i>Dragonflight</i></td> <td> <br><i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i></td> <td> <br><i>The Princess Bride</i></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br> See more recommendations from Stephenie Meyer<br><p></p> <p><br><strong>Q&amp;A with Stephanie Meyer</strong><br> </p><p><b>Q:</b> What book has had the most significant impact on your life?<br><b>A:</b> The book with the most significant impact on my life is <i>The Book of Mormon</i>. The book with the most significant impact on my life as a writer is probably <i>Speaker for the Dead</i>, by Orson Scott Card, with <i>Rebecca</i> by Daphne du Maurier coming in as a close second.<br><br><b>Q:</b> You are stranded on a desert island with only one book, one CD, and one DVD--what are they?<br><b>A:</b> The CD is easy: <i>Absolution</i> by Muse, hands down. It's harder to give myself just one movie, but the one I watch most frequently is <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>--the one with the screenplay by Emma Thompson. One book is impossible. I'd have to have <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, but I couldn't live without something by Orson Scott Card and a nice, thick Maeve Binchy, too.<br><br><b>Q:</b> What is the worst lie you've ever told?<br><b>A:</b> My lies are all very, very boring: "No, you really look great in hot pink!" "My children only watch one hour of TV a day." "I didn't eat the last Swiss Cake Roll--it must have been one of the kids." That's the best I've got.<br><br><b>Q:</b> Describe the perfect writing environment.<br><b>A:</b> It's late at night and the house is silent, but I'm still (miraculously) full of energy. I have my headphones in and I'm listened to a mix of Muse, Coldplay, Travis, My Chemical Romance, and The All-American Rejects. Beside me is a fabulous, and yet mysteriously low in calorie, cheesecake....<br><br><b>Q:</b> If you could write your own epitaph, what would it say?<br><b>A:</b> I'd like it to say that I really tried at the important things. I was never perfect at any of them, but I honestly tried to be a great mom, a loving wife, a good daughter, and a true friend. Under that, I'd want a list of my favorite <i>Simpsons</i> quotes.<br><br><b>Q:</b> Who is the one person living or dead that you would like to have dinner with?<br><b>A:</b> I'd love to have a chance to talk to Orson Scott Card--I have a million questions for him. Mostly things like, "How do you come up with this stuff?!" But, if he wasn't available, I'd settle for Matthew Bellamy (lead singer of Muse).<br><br><b>Q:</b> If you could have one superpower, what would it be?<br><b>A:</b> I'd want something offensive, rather than defensive. Like shooting fireballs from my hands. That way, you're really open to going either way--hero or villain. I like to have choices.<br> </p><br> <br>Stephenie Meyer is the author of the #1 bestselling Twilight Saga and <i>The Host</i>.

Kimball</h2><p>Understanding the gospel, concern for people, love for the Savior: these form the underlying theme of Faith Precedes the Miracle. In nearly three decades as a General Authority, President Kimball has spoken forthrightly to members of the Church, warning of the deceits of Satan and pointing out the road back for those who have erred and who yearn for reconciliation with the Lord. This book is based on some of his sermons and messages, but each one has been edited and revised to a reading style while retaining the basic, highly personal mode of expression. The subjects reflect a genuine concern for how Latter-day Saints can find joy and happiness through living gospel principles, including testimony and revelation, marriage and the family, morality and repentance, righteousness, and the restored church. Each message is an important, direct statement of gospel principles.</p><p></p><h2>Forty Years in Preschool</h2><p>This book tells about experiences and ideas garnered from my work in Early Childhood including: day care in Chile, university teaching, Head Start, a parent co-op, and as a Montessori teacher.</p><p></p><h2>The Vow</h2><p>She was the enemy he must destroy--no matter how much he wanted her....<br><br>Let the rich, dazzling voice of Juliana Garnett wrap you in the passion and pageantry of another time--and the tale of two well-defended hearts that must finally surrender...to desire.<br><br>She vowed she'd never yield...to the treachery of his plans or the heat of his passion....<br><br>Sent by William of Normandy to quell a brazen Saxon rebellion, Luc Louvat believed his mission would be easily accomplished.

The word <i>contemplation</i> is itself somewhat problematical, according to Thomas Merton: "It can become almost a magic word, or if not magic, then 'inspirational,' which is almost as bad." In this modern Christian classic, Merton reveals contemplation to be nothing other than "life itself, fully awake, fully active, fully aware that it is alive." The thirty-nine short "seeds" that make up this book are intended to awaken and cultivate the contemplative, mystical dimension of the spiritual path for everyone. <i>New Seeds of Contemplation </i> is a revised and expanded version of Merton's earlier book <i>Seeds of Contemplation. </i></p><p>"It can become almost a magic word," Thomas Merton says of contemplation; "or if not magic, then inspirational, which is almost as bad." With these words, Merton takes us through the reality of contemplation, which is, the author says, "life itself, fully awake, fully active, fully aware that it is alive. It is spiritual wonder." Above all, contemplation is "awareness of the reality" of the Source, "with a certitude that goes beyond reason and beyond simple faith." As these definitions should suggest, in this 20th-century classic on the contemplative life, as in the best of Merton's work, this Trappist monk wonderfully combines a disciplined and deeply learned intellect with the lyrical passion of the poet. It is this rare combination that makes this book not only informative but also moving. Covering a diverse range of subjects ("Faith," "The Night of the Senses," "Renunciation"), it moves the reader through certain traditional "phases" of contemplation, and gives an idea of what to expect in this spiritual process (including despair and darkness). The book describes, but it also enacts. In its own prose it invites the reader to "cast our awful solemnity to the winds and join in the general dance." <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>Thomas Merton (1915&#x2013;1968) was a Trappist monk, spiritual director, political activist, social critic, and one of the most-read spiritual writers of the twentieth century. He is the author of many books, including <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i>.</p><h2>The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods</h2><p>Discusses with a wealth of illustration and insight such subjects as the organization of the intellectual worker&#39;s time, materials, and his life.</p><p></p><h2>Charisma On Command: Inspire, Impress, and Energize Everyone You Meet</h2><p>Have you ever encountered someone with magnetic charisma?

How could I make a friend when I didn't even speak English? How could I understand a teacher or classmate? And how could I rely on my perplexed, frightened parents to help me cope?"<br>So begins New York Times reporter Joseph Berger's beguiling account of how one family of Polish Jews - with one son born at the close of World War II and the other one in a "displaced persons" camp outside Berlin - managed to make a life for themselves in an utterly foreign landscape. Displaced Persons speaks directly to a little-known slice of Holocaust history, illuminating as never before the experience of 140,000 refugees who came to the United States between 1947 and 1953.<br>The world of Manhattan's Upper West Side, in the shadow of Hitler's atrocities, has been the subject of some of Isaac Bashevis Singer's best fiction. But through the eyes of a bright and perceptive boy we come to understand the reality on a more visceral level. Like many immigrants and children of immigrants, Jospeh Berger lives in two worlds at the same time. On the one hand, there is this thrillingly rich American turf to explore as a child, and he does a brilliant job of bringing that adventure to life. On the other hand, he never lets us forget what it's like to feel intractably rooted in another, incompatible world of refugee parents who cannot speak English, a world of people dazed from unimaginable loss, and whose loneliness is unrelenting.</p><p><b>Joseph Berger</b> was born in Russia in 1945 and came to the United States when he was five years old. Currently deputy education editor at <i>The New York Times,</i> he has also reported on religion and education for the paper and served as its bureau chief in White Plains. The author of <i>The Young Scientists,</i> Berger lives in Larchmont, New York, with his wife and daughter.In Proustian fashion, this memoir begins with a flood of memories triggered by a seeded roll, a staple of Manhattan bakeries that was an early childhood treat for the author, who, along with his parents and brother, was a Polish-Jewish refugee living on New York's Upper West Side in the 1940s. From the smell and taste of fresh-baked bread, Berger, deputy education editor at the New York Times and author of The Young Scientists, tumbles headfirst into a tale about survival in a new country that was dangerous and mysterious as much as it was a haven of safety. Written in simple, elegant prose, the book largely focuses on Berger's parents' lives (particularly before the war). His father, whose Yiddish gave the family vital access to the city's Jewish community even though the author viewed it as "the mark of a conversational cripple," is a quiet man who could be moved to violence when necessary to protect his family. His mother conveys to her children the complex tapestry of their European heritage. Both come alive in this vivid narrative, softened by a reflective somberness that is only occasionally tinged by nostalgia. Berger frequently interrupts his own story with shorter anecdotes in the voices of his parents, who tell stories about their families and their childhoods that both enhance and illuminate the primary story. By conjuring a complexly interwoven familial history that takes the reader across the boundaries of time, Berger lays the foundation for his thoughts about the larger immigrant experience.

Never has the old line about those who fail to understand the past being condemned to repeat it seemed more urgently relevant than in Iraq today, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the Iraqi people, the Middle East region, and the world. Examining the construction of the modern state of Iraq under the auspices of the British empire&#x2015;the first attempt by a Western power to remake Mesopotamia in its own image&#x2015;renowned Iraq expert Toby Dodge uncovers a series of shocking parallels between the policies of a declining British empire and those of the current American administration.<br><br>Between 1920 and 1932, Britain endeavored unsuccessfully to create a modern democratic state from three former provinces of the Ottoman Empire, which it had conquered and occupied during the First World War. Caught between the conflicting imperatives of controlling a region of great strategic importance (Iraq straddled the land and air route between British India and the Mediterranean) and reconstituting international order through the liberal ideal of modern state sovereignty under the League of Nations Mandate system, British administrators undertook an extremely difficult task. To compound matters, they did so without the benefit of detailed information about the people and society they sought to remake. Blinded by potent cultural stereotypes and subject to mounting pressures from home, these administrators found themselves increasingly dependent on a mediating class of shaikhs to whom they transferred considerable power and on whom they relied for the maintenance of order. When order broke down, as it routinely did, the British turned to the airplane. (This was Winston Churchill's lasting contribution to the British enterprise in Iraq: the concerted use of air power&#x2015;of what would in a later context be called "shock and awe"&#x2015;to terrorize and subdue dissident factions of the Iraqi people.)<br><br>Ultimately, Dodge shows, the state the British created held all the seeds of a violent, corrupt, and relentlessly oppressive future for the Iraqi people, one that has continued to unfold. Like the British empire eight decades before, the United States and Britain have taken upon themselves today the grand task of transforming Iraq and, by extension, the political landscape of the Middle East. Dodge contends that this effort can succeed only with a combination of experienced local knowledge, significant deployment of financial and human resources, and resolute staying power. Already, he suggests, ominous signs point to a repetition of the sequence of events that led to the long nightmare of Saddam Hussein's murderous tyranny.</p><p>Offering a penetrating history of the formation of modern Iraq, Dodge uncovers numerous troubling parallels between the policies of a declining British empire and those of the current American government, which together form a timely and trenchant cautionary tale.Toby Dodge is a senior research fellow at the ESRC Centre for the Study of Globalisation at the University of Warwick, England, and an associate fellow of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, London.

The cause was a leaky, noisy automobile--the first the boy had ever seen. At that moment Honda fell in love with cars, and a dream took hold. He would one day make them himself. It took Honda many years to reach his goal. Along the way he became an expert mechanic and manufacturer of car parts. After World War II he developed a motorized bicycle, the forerunner of his innovative motorcycles. Eventually Honda began manufacturing cars, first race cars and then consumer cars. Constantly seeking ways to make his products better than his competitors&#39;, Honda grew into a global industry leader. Soichiro Honda had an inventive mind and a passion for new ideas, and he never gave up on his dream. A legendary figure in the world of manufacturing, Honda is a dynamic symbol of lifelong determination, creativity, and the power of a dream.</p><p>Mark Weston is a former attorney, journalist, and Jeopardy! contestant. He is now a full-time writer. He lives in Armonk, New York.Weston presents Honda as a perfectionist, an innovator in his field and a model corporate leader, who encouraged his workers, listened to them and treated them well. . . . Yamasaki's detailed and whimsical acrylics add zest to the proceedings. A worthwhile introduction to a neglected subject. --Kirkus Reviews<br><br>This picture-book biography follows the life of Soichiro Honda, born in 1906, from his beginnings as a boy working in his father's smith shop to his international success as a manufacturer. Weston's writing is clear and accessible, even to those who might not know any automotive lingo. The book reads like a story, with fictionalization of Honda's thoughts and dialogue and emphasis on his persistence and ingenuity. Yamasaki's acrylic illustrations dominate each page. . . . Readers will find little men climbing on the engine parts and pieces of machinery swirling up into the air like dust, miniature cars going around a globe and down Honda's arm, and figures on tiny motorcycles on mountains as a backdrop to modern, colorfully clad men and women riding on the road. Yamasaki's creative composition makes the pictures interesting and dynamic. There has been very little published about Honda for children. This story takes a step toward filling that gap. --School Library Journal<br><br>Yamasaki helps to keep the tone light with fanciful painted illustrations that depict her subject set amid flying car parts and streams of tiny automobiles and motorcycles. Honda is neatly portrayed as someone who was smart enough both to stay in touch with his employees . . . and take early retirement. Though a demanding boss, Honda was not so much a driven, Olympian business leader, but rather a human being who found his bliss early on and stuck with it through thick and thin. --Booklist</p><h2>The Peach Keeper</h2><p><p>It's the dubious distinction of thirty-year-old Willa Jackson to hail from a Southern family of means that met with financial ruin generations ago. The Blue Ridge Madam was built by Willa's great-great-grandfather during Walls of Water's heyday. It now stands as a lonely monument to misfortune and scandal. Willa herself has strived to build a life beyond the brooding Jackson family shadow -- no easy task in a town shaped by the well-marked boundaries of the haves and have-nots.</p><p>But Willa has lately learned that socialite do-gooder Paxton Osgood, of the very prominent Osgood family, has restored the Blue Ridge Madam to her former glory and plans to open a top-notch inn. Could the troubled past finally be laid to rest? Not very likely now that a skeleton has been found buried beneath the property's lone peach tree. Along with the bones, long-kept secrets surrounding the remains have also surfaced. Thrust together in an unlikely friendship, Willa and Paxton must confront the dangerous passions and tragic betrayals that once bound their families.</p></p><p><b>A Letter from Author Sarah Addison Allen</b> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <i>She put a penny on her windowsill and cracked the window, because her grandmother once said that ghosts often forget they&#x2019;re ghosts and will go after money, but if they get close enough to an open window, the night air will suck them out.</i> <br> --Chapter Eight, <i>The Peach Keeper</i> <p></p> The original title of <i>The Peach Keeper</i> was <i>God Eats Peaches</i>, which I took from the old saying, &#x201c;When God eats peaches, He saves the pit.&#x201d; I had a cousin who would never throw away a peach pit based on that saying. She thought it was bad luck. My family is full of strange Southern superstitions. My great-aunt never liked for company to come in through one door and leave through another because she said that meant the preacher would visit. <p></p> How many of us grew up seeing our mothers throw a pinch of salt over their shoulders when salt was spilled? How many of us remember when our grandmothers whispered that a bird tapping on a window meant someone was going to die? We took these things on trembling faith as children, believing them to be real because <i>everything</i> was real back then. Everything had possibilities. So how do we explain, with our skeptical grown-up natures, why we still make an X in the air when a black cat passes. Why we still have to eat something in the morning before we will tell someone about our bad dreams. Why we still worry about umbrellas being opened indoors. <p></p> What is it about superstitions that stay with us, that encourage us to pass them on? Flights of fancy, maybe. Or nostalgia. Or maybe the power of the unknown is just that strong. We can&#x2019;t help but think: What if it&#x2019;s true? <i>What if it just might be true?</i> So we take an ounce of prevention instead of a pound of cure.

This book traces their rise against a richly varied backdrop. Its range encompasses literature, religion, and the visual arts, as well as economics, public policy, and the history of medicine. Its cast of characters includes a host of remarkable figures in or around advertising, from P. T. Barnum and Theodore Dreiser to John B. Watson and Joseph Cornell. The book explores the ways that advertising collaborated with other cultural institutions to produce what have become the dominant aspirations, anxieties, and even notions of personal identity in the twentieth-century United States. Moving from the carnivals and market fairs of Renaissance Europe to the traveling peddlers of nineteenth-century America, Jackson Lears shows how early advertisers encouraged a new kind of magical thinking, detached from religious traditions and geared to an emerging market society. While patent medicine advertising&#39;s promise of magical self-transformation and exotic sensuality posed challenges to moral standards, advertisers themselves eventually sought to contain the subversive potential of this promise even as they continued to conjure it up.<b>Jackson Lears</b> is the author of <i>No Place of Grace: Antimodernism and the Transformation of American Culture, 1880&#x2013;1920</i>, and the editor (with Richard Fox) of <i>The Culture of Consumption</i> and <i>The Power of Culture</i>. He is professor of history at Rutgers University.</p><h2>The Travels of Marco Polo: The Complete Yule-Cordier Edition, Vol. 2</h2><p>As many schoolchildren know, Marco Polo (c. 1254-1324) was a Venetian traveler who, with his father and uncle, traveled to the Orient and brought back fabulous stories of exotic lands and people to an unbelieving medieval Europe. The journey lasted 25 years, 17 of which were spent at the court of Kublai Khan, the Chinese emperor. At some point after his return home, Marco Polo was imprisoned by the Genoese, then at war with Venice. It proved to be a fortunate incarceration, for while in prison Marco Polo dictated the story of his travels to a fellow-prisoner, a writer named Rustichello. The book that resulted is one of the greatest books of all time &#x2014; a vast treasury of valuable observations on the people and geography of the Near East and Asia, with detailed descriptions of cities, customs, crops, animals, and wildlife, laws, political systems, and more.<br>Reprinted here in two volumes, with extensive editorial apparatus and some 200 illustrations, <i>The Travels of Marco Polo</i> offers a sweeping panorama of Persia, China, Japan, and other lands in the last half of the thirteenth century. This Dover edition is reprinted from the third edition (1903), revised and updated by Henri Cordier, of the magnificent translation made by Sir Henry Yule in 1871. Of inestimable value are the extensive notations by Yule that clarify and expand each chapter of the book. Also included in the Dover edition is a memoir of Sir Henry Yule by his daughter and the extensive addenda that Cordier published in 1920. Nearly 200 black-and-white illustrations (many double-page spread) and 32 maps and site plans augment the text.</p><p></p><h2>Maus: A Survivor&#39;s Tale Part II: And Here My Troubles Began</h2><p>&#34;Maus I&#34; was the first half of the tale of survival of the author&#39;s parents, charting their desperate progress from pre-war Poland Auschwitz.

But now she's back among the kooks and crazies, the small-time losers and the jerks who think she's fair game just because she's in a waitress uniform.</p><p>The truth is, Veronica's the boss&#x2014;at least until she can sell the family saloon and skip town again as fast as her pretty legs can carry her&#x2014;and nobody knows that better than Cooper Blackstock. From his place behind the bar, the former Special Forces Marine sees everything. And his undercover agenda has made the feisty boss-lady's troubles his own.</p><p>And her troubles are considerable, what with a family in turmoil, a pseudo-bartender with dangerous secrets, a murder investigation and death threats. Though the town surprisingly rallies in support, it's still a good thing that Cooper will be there to catch Veronica if she stumbles&#x2014;if he doesn't start falling himself.</p></p><p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Susan Andersen lives in the Pacific Northwest with her husband of a <em>really</em> long time and their kitty boys, Boo and Mojo.</p>Coming one year after Andersen's highly praised All Shook Up, this frisky romantic caper lacks the effervescent humor of her previous book but compensates with its true-to-life characters and careful treatment of complex issues such as trust and acceptance. Seattle-based restoration designer Veronica Davis never thought she'd waitress at her family's bar, the Honky Tonk, again. But when her ne'er-do-well sister, Crystal, is murdered and the accused Crystal's estranged ex, Eddie skips bail, Veronica finds herself filling in at the Tonk and taking care of her six-year-old niece. Her time at the bar would be almost bearable if it weren't for the Tonk's antagonistic bartender, Cooper Blackstock, an ex-marine who assumes that she's merely a replica of her conniving sister. Fortunately, Cooper's stupidity doesn't last long, and the two become engaged in a heated affair. Before they can think of building a future together, however, Veronica must learn to accept Cooper for who he is and Cooper must come clean about his relationship to Eddie. This novel deals with weightier themes than Andersen's earlier titles, but it still sparkles with all the elements that her readers adore upbeat dialogue, strong sexual chemistry, a touch of suspense and a dash of humor.

The Music at Long Verney collects twenty of her best short stories, most of them from the great years at The New Yorker. They span a full half-century, from 1929 to 1977, and are crowded with irrepressible, living characters and even more animated objects and incidents. There are stories of romantic love and the mysteries of marriage; of artists who speak the truth even as they distort reality; of gardens and houses and very fine things and of those who fancy themselves their owners. The centerpiece of the collection is a series of five linked stories about an eccentric establishment, the Abbey Antiques Gallery, and its singular proprietor, the urbane Mr. Edom. Some of these stories are hilarious, others hauntingly lyrical, but all are incomparably witty and original-in short, they&#39;re vintage Warner. On every page, writes John Updike, there is something to be seen or smelled or felt... Beneath her refined witchery lies a strange freshness one can only call, in praise, primitive.</p><p>Sylvia Townsend Warner published some thirty books, among them seven novels and ten collections of short stories. She died in at eighty-four in 1978, in her longtime home, the village of Maiden Newton in Dorset, England.</p><h2>The Long Game: A Fixer Novel</h2><p><p>For Tess Kendrick, a junior at the elite Hardwicke School in Washington D.C., fixing runs in the family.

And, to celebrate this special occasion, Sterling presents a gorgeous new edition of <i>The Secret Garden</i>, illustrated by the acclaimed Robert Ingpen. <br>After her parents' death, Mary Lennox-a plain, sickly, and unloved little girl-leaves her home in India to stay in her uncle's English manor. There, thanks to a very special hidden garden and some wonderful new friends, she undergoes a physical and spiritual transformation that ultimately affects the lives of all around her. <br>Robert Ingpen's stunning art fully captures the story's poignancy and beauty-making this a volume that parents and children will treasure forever. <br></p><p>Mistress Mary is quite contrary until she helps her garden grow. Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate.

If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic wil work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>The Time of the Assassins</h2><p>A study of the 1981 attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II argues that the would-be killer was not a fanatic working on his own, but was part of a full-scale, international conspiracy</p><p></p><h2>Tear Me Apart: A Novel</h2><p>The follow-up to her critically acclaimed <em>Lie to Me,</em> J.T.

The second volume was commenced; and it was the Author's intention to have proceeded to its completion. But, having attended The British Association for the Advancement of Science, held that year at Cambridge, he wrote thence to his printer, stating, that he was labouring under severe bodily affliction; that he should endeavour to reach home as speedily as possible; and adding, as it were prophetically, that he should never leave it again, till he was conveyed to his grace. So deeply interested, however, did Mr. Higgins feel in the completion of his work, that he wrote frequently - alternately expressing hope and doubt of his recovery.

Johnson and his wife Carolyn reside in Westfield, NJ.Chilling account of the multiple murders that shocked newspaper readers and TV viewers in 1971, and stunned them 18 years later when the killer was at last caught through the auspices of a popular TV program. As Benford (author of several quiz books) and Johnson ably explain, the mother, wife, and three children of John Emil List were found shot to death and carefully laid out in their unheated Westfield, N.J., home. The only family member missing was List himself--who admitted his guilt in a letter to his Lutheran pastor. Reclusive, deeply religious, and seemingly devoted to his family, List was an unlikely mass murderer, with an unlikely reason for gunning down his family: Facing financial difficulties and fearing that his wife and children were falling away from religion, List decided to assure their eternal salvation by murdering them. He then ran off to start a new life as one Robert Clark, remarried, and was caught nearly two decades later when his picture was broadcast on TV's America's Most Wanted. Drawing on interviews with List neighbors and law officers, the authors have uncovered some astonishing sidelights to the case. List's wife, Helen, for instance, was apparently dying of tertiary syphilis; and there is evidence that daughter Patricia was dabbling in witchcraft. Well-organized and fast-paced, with convincing insights into the minds of List and his victims: a true-crime success.

All rights reserved.</i></p><h2>The Call to Holiness</h2><p>The word holiness comes from the Hebrew word, kadash, which means "to separate" or "to set apart" or "to distinguish." Holiness is central to the Christian understanding of the gospel, and we are called to be holy because of the simple fact that God is holy. <br> <br> The meditations in The Call to Holiness: Pursuing the Heart of God for the Love of the World explore how God's holiness is manifested within the larger framework of His self-revelation as found in the Bible and in our lives. <br> <br> These short reflections demonstrate that holiness-along with all of God's other amazing attributes-always informs who He is in all of His dealings with us. An examination of this important doctrine will lead us to a deeper relationship with God and one another, and ultimately, will affect how we live in the world.</p><p></p><h2>An Affair of Honor</h2><p><br>In this powerful novel&#x2014;the capstone to Richard Marius&#x2019;s illustrious career&#x2014;a gripping double murder propels the small, Bible-obsessed town of Bourbonville, Tennessee, into connection with the wider society opening up in the years following World War II.<br><br>At the center: Charles Alexander, twenty, groomed from birth by his mother to be a Baptist minister, <br>teetering on the edge of his faith. In his last year of college, working late one night at the newspaper office, he accidentally witnesses the murders. The killer is Hope Kirby, World War II hero, member of a large mountain clan of farmers, who has discovered his wife&#x2019;s infidelity. Although Kirby&#x2019;s code of honor requires that he exact vengeance, it won&#x2019;t allow him to kill an innocent bystander, and Charles goes free, promising not to tell what he&#x2019;s seen.<br><br>But Charles does tell, and we watch, fascinated, as a trial, an appeal, and a new terror unleashed on the countryside draw the entire county into the action. Among the people most closely involved: the skillful, overweight, hard-drinking lawyer for the defense; two Baptist preachers&#x2014;one liberal, one a strict constructionist&#x2014;each with a secret to hide; a lady banker determinedly headed for trouble; a big-hearted good- <br>old-boy sheriff; Charles&#x2019;s disturbingly freewheeling, freethinking sometime college girlfriend. Most importantly, we see the Kirby clan: Pappy, whose extraordinary patience, hard work, and self-reliance cause his hardscrabble farm to prosper until he&#x2019;s turned out by the coming of a national park; and the five Kirby sons, who are trying hard to make a new place for themselves in the town.<br><br>As these and others play their parts in the affair of honor, we see Charles and the Kirbys begin to reexamine their dramatically opposing but equally encapsulated ways of viewing life&#x2014;fundamentalist Christian and ancient &#x201c;code of the hills.&#x201d; And as the novel draws to its climactic and satisfying close, we see them&#x2014;and finally the entire town&#x2014;profoundly, permanently changed.</p><p>I first met Richard Marius, as is appropriate for an editor, through his writing--specifically by working on his second novel, <b>Bound for the Promised Land</b>, which came my way in 1973. By the time I met Richard face to face several months later, I had already traveled from his fictional territory of Bourbon County in East Tennessee to California with as contentious and god-struck crew of gold rushers as anyone would ever want to know, and I was extremely curious about their author. I was not disappointed. <br><br>As anyone who ever met him knew, Richard was as much fun, as full of stories and energy, and exuberant good feelings as the oversized mythical characters who peopled his novels. And he was an editor's dream. <br><br>Richard was simply never as a loss for words. They poured out of him in a Southern accent but in cadences of the King James Bible, which had been read aloud to him as a child from cover to cover several times over, and with a delight in expression found in Shakespeare. Sometimes there were too many words. But he was never averse to cutting. <br><br>One of his favorite stories was about arriving at the Knopf offices with two bags full of the 2000 pages that were the first draft of his third novel, <b>After the War</b>, and dropping them off with a thud that reverberated throughout the entire building, flinging out his arms and saying "Here it is!" We lifted whole sections from books, one long enough to make a small novel by itself. <br><br>He was also never at a loss for a story. And these stories found their way into four novels, set over a hundred years in his ficitonal Bourbon County. <b>The Coming of Rain</b>, published in 1969, <b>Bound for the Promised Land</b>, in 1976, <b>After the War</b> in 1992, and now, his final novel, published on September 18, 2001, <b>An Affair of Honor</b>. Each of the novels is set against a historical event of major importance--the westward immigration, the aftermath of the Civil War, the dislocations of the First and Second World Wars. But these events happen to individual characters so rich and well-realized that they fairly leap of the page, folk he described in <b>The Coming of Rain</b> as "country people posessed of a rich, Biblical imagination." People who often took their origin from the local stories he published from high school onwards in his hometown <i>Lenoir City News</i>. <br><br>In the same way that his journalism and his own storytelling worked its way into the novels, and his historical training gave them weight, his novelistic ability helped make his biographies of two of the three great Reformation figures--<b>Thomas More</b> (1983) and <b>Martin Luther</b> (1994)--works of breathtaking readability along with their original and solid scholarship. <br><br>Writing novels and Reformation history was only part of Richard's life, the part I knew best, of course. But he had a whole other career in academia, having been a professor of Reformation History at the University of Tennessee and director of Expository Writing at Harvard from 1978 to 1998, when he retired. Over 30,000 freshmen had their first taste of college level writing in Marius's Expository Writing Program, the only required course at Harvard. He was immensely involved in the program, attending every section and always teaching one or more classes himself. Two books, <b>A Writer's Companion</b> and <b>A Short Guide to Writing About History</b>, grew out of these experiences. A popular, beloved teacher of Twain and Faulkner, he also, during summers, directed the Governor's academy for high school teachers of writing in Tennessee. <br><br>I and all who knew and loved him miss him, but it is a wonderful gift to have this last book he wrote, <b>An Affair of Honor</b>, finished only months before he died, the final book of his Bourbon County Trilogy. <br>--Ann ClosePraise for <i>After the War</i> by Richard Marius<br>"A rich and wonderful novel . . . an old-fashioned blockbuster chock full of wildness and enough excitement for three novels . . . It moved me, made me laugh out loud, broke my heart, and made me so tense that at several points I could barely turn the pages . . . The man is a consummate storyteller and a loving, wise, and compassionate writer."<br>-Robert Ward, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"It's not merely good. It is amazingly good . . . a feast of Americana, rich in history and biography, riveting in plot, lavish in humanity, graced at all points by keen intelligence and masterful prose."<br>-Andy Solomon, <i>The Boston Globe</i><br><br>"He has created a blockbuster . . . <i>After the War</i> earns its accolades because of its broad vision and superb storytelling . . . It is a tribute to Richard Marius's talent that after all he writes you want to hear more, not less."<br>-William Rodarmor, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"Sumptuous . . . a big novel packed with classic themes: the deadly consequences of ambition and greed; the heaven-bound quest of the soul; industrial progress vs. the agrarian ideal; the ties that bind parents to children, men to women, people to place."<br>-Margarita Fichtner, <i>The Miami Herald</i><br><br>"A loving if unrelenting vision of the South . . . both a big, old-fashioned book stuffed with hardy characters and adorable eccentrics, and a daring assault on all such sentimentality."<br>-Paul Skenazy, <i>The Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"Casts a burnished spell. The moonshine whiskey is potent, and religion is as lethal as the Spanish Flu that rakes the country in 1918. The Tennessee townpeople provide plenty of Scotch-Irish humor. This is fine, somber writing."<br>-Cary Holladay, <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i><br><br>"'Magnificent' describes the expansiveness of Mr. Marius's vision and the eloquence of the captivating prose he sculpts with masterly precision to convey that era's [World War I] multifaceted complexity."<br>-Bob Summer, <i>The Atlanta Constitution</i><br><br>"I flat-out love this book-it is poignant, wise, commonsensical, mature, and insightful. In short, Richard Marius has given us a great and glorious novel, fun to read and yet a true work of art which deserves a permanent position on major literary lists."<br>-Tom C. Armstrong, <i>The Nashville Tennessean</i><br><br>"One of the most remarkable novels I've ever read, a panoramic saga of life and love and hatred and violence, a compelling story that is almost impossible to put down . . . deserves to be recognized as one of the great contemporary novels."<br>-Don McKinney, <i>The Hilton Head Packet</i><br></p><h2>The Illustrated Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion</h2><p>A skillfully abridged and illustrated edition of Sir James Frazer&#39;s masterpiece.</p><p></p><h2>The Raven Crown: The Origins of Buddhist Monarchy in Bhutan</h2><p>The hereditary monarchy of the Wangchuk dynasty was established in 1907 in the independent Himalayan state of Bhutan, thus introducing one of the world&#39;s most recent experiments in kingship. The new order quickly replaced a theocracy founded in the seventeenth century by the first of the &#34;Dharma Rajas&#34;, a lineage of reincarnating lamas known by the title of Shabdrung. The first king of the new dynasty, Ugyen Wangchuk (1862-1926), was a charismatic figure who came to power against a turbulent background of incessant and complex feuding. He adopted as the unique symbol of his authority a crown surmounted by the head of a raven. The bird represents a form of Mahakala, Bhutan&#39;s guardian deity. The prototype of the founding monarch&#39;s Raven Crown had first been devised as a battle helmet for his father, Jigme Namgyel (1825-81). Known as the Black Regent, he had worn it in bloody struggles against his many rivals within the country and against the British who tried, unsuccessfully, to subdue him. The story of the Wangchuk dynasty&#39;s rise and triumph moves from a picture of turmoil and chaos to one of relative peace and stability. In contrast with earlier published ac- counts based solely on the colonial records of British India, here the narrative is founded on the Bhutanese chronicles which offer a new perspective and bring many new details to light. The ethnic and historical context is outlined before recounting the turbulent career of the Black Regent, followed by the lives and achievements of the first two kings. The book is copiously illustrated with rare historical photographs that have come to light in private and public collections in the United Kingdom. Most of these vivid images have never previously been published. They provide a lively depth and focus to the unfolding narrative.</p><p>Michael Aris (1946-1999) was Research Fellow in Tibetan and Himalayan Studies at St Antony&#x2019;s College, Oxford.

As Martha Nussbaum reveals in this penetrating look at India today, the forces of the Hindu right pose a disturbing threat to its democratic traditions and secular state. <br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>Since long before the 2002 Gujarat riots--in which nearly two thousand Muslims were killed by Hindu extremists--the power of the Hindu right has been growing, threatening India's hard-won constitutional practices of democracy, tolerance, and religious pluralism. Led politically by the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu right has sought the subordination of other religious groups and has directed particular vitriol against Muslims, who are cast as devils in need of purging. The Hindu right seeks to return to a "pure" India, unsullied by alien polluters of other faiths, yet the BJP's defeat in recent elections demonstrates the power that India's pluralism continues to wield. The future, however, is far from secure, and Hindu extremism and exclusivity remain a troubling obstacle to harmony in South Asia.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>Nussbaum's long-standing professional relationship with India makes her an excellent guide to its recent history. Ultimately she argues that the greatest threat comes not from a clash between civilizations, as some believe, but from a clash within each of us, as we oscillate between self-protective aggression and the ability to live in the world with others. India's story is a cautionary political tale for all democratic states striving to act responsibly in an increasingly dangerous world.<br></p></p><p>Martha C. Nussbaum is Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago.This is an extraordinarily interesting book on a very difficult subject. Martha Nussbaum's commanding familiarity with culturally related political issues across the world, past and present, combines immensely fruitfully here with her involvement and understanding of India. (Amartya Sen, Harvard University)<br><br>This impressive and important book grapples with the problems and consequences of religious extremism. Nussbaum's brilliant analysis of the controversy over religion and democracy in India effortlessly moves between political history, philosophy, and law, to give us a powerful and compelling narrative of the political world of the Hindu Right. It is a must-read for all those interested in understanding the dangers of religious extremism and of what preserves democracy and pluralism in the face of tensions and conflicts within. (Zoya Hasan, Jawaharlal Nehru University)<br><br>Preoccupation with the purported clash between civilizations has masked the clash within democracies. This passionate, engaged book has much to teach an American audience about the vulnerability and resilience of Indian democracy. Perhaps it will also stimulate reflections about similar clashes within American democracy. (Amrita Basu, Amherst College)<br><br>Once more, Martha Nussbaum has applied her profound philosophical intelligence to a challenging question in the practical world. In thinking through the dangers raised by the Hindu right, she teaches us a great deal about the dangers of dogmatism everywhere. (K. Anthony Appiah, Princeton University)<br><br>Few contemporary philosophers in the West have reckoned with India's complex experience of democracy; and even fewer have engaged with it as vigorously as [Nussbaum] does in <i>The Clash Within</i>...[A] strongly felt and stimulating book.

I cannot recommend it highly enough.

Her thesis supports Ghandi's claim that "the real struggle that democracy must wage is the struggle within the individual self, between the urge to dominate and defile the other, and a willingness to live respectfully on terms of compassion and equality." (Salil Tripathi <i>New Statesman</i> 2007-08-06)<br><br>Nussbaum sounds a wake-up call to those who may have been unaware of the ugly nature of events in India in recent times, and the hate-filled ideology that informs them...As further evidence of the undemocratic danger that India now faces, Nussbaum turns to the attempt of the Hindu Right to hijack history and rewrite the Indian past to demonize Muslims and glorify Hindus.

HARV EKER, author of Secrets of the Millionaire Mind</p><p>As Money Girl, I love answering people&#x2019;s questions and sharing helpful financial information and timely tips. In addition to enjoying the nuts and bolts of things like retirement accounts, mortgages, and taxes, I&#x2019;m also fascinated by the way people think about money. I call it our money mind-set. Your money mind-set&#x2014;or thoughts about money&#x2014;are important because they&#x2019;re the precursor to your behavior. In other words, your thoughts turn into actions. If your money mind-set is unhealthy, it only makes sense that you&#x2019;ll probably make some (or a lot of) financial mistakes.</p><p>Many people make the same slip-ups with money over and over again because they&#x2019;re stuck in bad patterns of behavior. They may know an awful lot about making good investments, for example, but can&#x2019;t ever manage to spend less than they make each month and so waste all of their investment knowledge when they have nothing to invest with. The problem isn&#x2019;t a lack of knowledge or the economy&#x2014;it&#x2019;s them! It&#x2019;s not all gloom and doom, however, because bad financial habits can be fixed. Raising your awareness about them is half the battle. Then you can put the information, tips, and tools in this book into action to take control of your money and make the smart moves needed to get your personal finances back on track and start growing your wealth. In this chapter, I&#x2019;ll help you think about some of the issues that may be getting in the way of your ability to make the most of your money. Let&#x2019;s start by looking at how you&#x2019;ve grown to relate to money over the years and bring to light any bad habits you&#x2019;ve picked up along the way.</p><p>What&#x2019;s Your Relationship with Money?</p><p>We usually inherit our money mind-set from our parents or close role models. How we relate to money on a psychological level begins to take shape early in life. That&#x2019;s because young minds can&#x2019;t help but absorb a great deal of their parents&#x2019; viewpoints. This became obvious to me when I backpacked through Europe with a good friend during the summer after my junior year in college. Neither one of us had a lot of money for the trip, but we decided that we&#x2019;d travel until our money ran out. Back then, it was realistic for budget travelers to tour Europe on $30 a day. According to my plan, after purchasing flights and train passes, spending no more than $30 a day would keep us afloat in Europe for about a month. My goal was to spend as little as possible so we could stay as long as possible. I was willing to sleep in bunk rooms at youth hostels and to live on bread and water to stretch our funds. But my friend wanted to have more fun, eat fancier meals, and stay at better hotels&#x2014;even if it meant coming home a little earlier. She simply wasn&#x2019;t as frugal as I was and we both had to compromise. We had the time of our lives&#x2014;though a shorter time than I would have liked!</p><p>I realized that being a little frugal comes naturally to me because that&#x2019;s how I was raised. Even though my parents never actually said, &#x201c;Laura, you should be frugal with your money,&#x201d; I learned from them by observing their actions. We really didn&#x2019;t talk about money much, but they always focused their resources on what was important to them and never seemed to spend money on whims or fads. That gave me an idea of how to be responsible with money.</p><p>Think back to your childhood. If you grew up in a home where there wasn&#x2019;t enough money for the necessities, you might have heard, &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have money for that!&#x201d; or &#x201c;Do you think money grows on trees?&#x201d; when begging for that new Barbie or Transformer. If money was tight in your household you might have grown up thinking that it was hard to earn or that it was impossible to have enough. If your parents constantly fought about how to pay the bills, you might have grown up subconsciously feeling that money was a source of tension or a destructive force in relationships. Or, if you were raised in an affluent family where it was important to keep up the image of wealth, you might still think that you should buy expensive brands, fancy cars, and lead a materialistic lifestyle. Regardless of what kind of household you grew up in, it&#x2019;s likely that your biases and beliefs about money from childhood have stuck with you. Some beliefs&#x2014;like the importance of delayed gratification&#x2014;serve us well, but unfortunately, many don&#x2019;t, like the importance of buying expensive brands.</p><p>In addition to subconsciously forming some of our strongly held ideas about money when we were only children, the majority of us were taught little or nothing about personal finances during our secondary education. I graduated from a school known for giving a great education. Even though it was, and still is, a fantastic institution, there wasn&#x2019;t a class about money back then. I had a lot of fun making scarves in knitting class (yes, knitting!), but I can&#x2019;t help feeling like my time would have been better spent learning how to balance a checkbook! So don&#x2019;t feel bad if there&#x2019;s a gap in your education when it comes to money matters. Many fellow MBAs I know graduated without being required to take a personal finance class, and they probably have no idea about a lot of everyday money matters. If you lack an educational foundation (formal or informal) for managing your finances, it&#x2019;s very possible that you can lose a great deal of money, no matter how much you have. Conversely, if you make a modest income, but become skilled at money management, you can make the right moves necessary to become quite wealthy over time.</p><p>This book will help you form a better relationship with your money, no matter how much of it you have and no matter what your money mind-set right now. After you read it, I urge you to share your financial knowledge with family members or friends who might benefit from your good sense. Without basic financial education, anyone can create money troubles that are difficult to resolve. When that happens, we run the risk of living in perpetual fear about the state of our finances. That burden can hold us back from living the kind of life we truly want for ourselves and for our families.</p><p>Big, Bad Financial Habits (And Little Ones, Too)</p><p>What stops many people from achieving the bank account and financial stability they dream of are bad spending habits. It&#x2019;s the small things we do day after day, week after week, and year after year that affect our overall financial health. That&#x2019;s good news! That means making little changes is how you&#x2019;ll be able to take total control of your finances. The tips and advice I&#x2019;ll give you in this book won&#x2019;t require that you go out and make all kinds of major changes all at once&#x2014;that&#x2019;s not realistic. It&#x2019;s the little changes&#x2014;the baby steps&#x2014;that will add up to big results with the power to be life changing. But before we can even talk about making small changes, let&#x2019;s figure out if you have any bad financial habits that need to be broken.</p><p>The most common bad financial habit is living above your means&#x2014;that&#x2019;s when your spending is higher than your income. Anyone can spend excessively by taking out loans or making purchases on credit. If you read the introduction to this book, you know that even included me. Living above your means is akin to inhabiting an imaginary place that I call the Dangerous Debt Zone. Unfortunately, it&#x2019;s easy to get there. And if you stay there too long, you will suffer financial injury. If you currently live there, don&#x2019;t worry. Chapter 5 will equip you with the tools you need to get yourself out in no time. But before we can even begin thinking about getting out of debt, we must first realize what got us there in the first place and why we overspend.</p><p>See if you recognize yourself in any of these:</p><ul><li>You fall prey to equating self-image with material things </li><li>You crave the thrill of shopping and buying </li><li>You feel entitled to have what others may have </li><li>You&#x2019;re too generous </li><li>You can&#x2019;t delay gratification </li><li>You lack personal responsibility</li></ul><p>Let&#x2019;s take a closer look at each of these reasons for overspending so we can put an end to it for good. That&#x2019;s step one on the journey toward financial well-being.</p><p>Why We Overspend</p><p>As consumers, many of us get brainwashed by the successful branding efforts of product marketers and advertisers. We hear radio commercials and see television, magazine, and billboard ads almost constantly. Most of us are deeply affected by branding, even if we say we&#x2019;re not. Marketers purposefully create brands to act as psychological shortcuts. A psychological shortcut means that the consumer doesn&#x2019;t spend much time considering a given purchase; they just put it in their shopping cart and head to the check-out aisle. I know I&#x2019;m guilty of doing this every time I go to the grocery store.</p><p>There&#x2019;s an irony about the brands we buy. If you think about it, many times the brands we purchase reflect who we want to be, not who we are. For example, if we aren&#x2019;t wealthy but want to be seen as though we are, we buy brands that portray an image of being wealthy, such as Mercedes, Rolex, or Louis Vuitton. We may become attracted to brands and their associated images that we feel disconnected from in our life. For example, if we feel detached from nature, perhaps we buy brands that are associated with the rustic spirit of the outdoors, like Jeep, Patagonia, or The North Face. Or, if we feel old, we might be partial to brands we link to a youthful, vibrant culture like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch or Juicy Couture. What I&#x2019;m saying is that brand...</p></p><h2>Awaiting the Moon</h2><p>Hired by Count Nikolas von Wolfram to transform his petulant niece into a suitable bride for a young Earl, Elizabeth Stanwycke senses that something is amiss with her new employer, to whom she is powerfully attracted, as wolf howls echo through the night. Original.</p><p>Set in 1795, the atmospheric first book in Simpson's new paranormal romance series serves up gothic suspense and explicit sex among denizens of a German castle. One moonlit evening, as Englishwoman Elizabeth Stanwycke approaches Wolfram Castle, home of the sullen girl whom she's been hired to tutor, Elizabeth sees a nude blond woman run across the highway, pursued into the snowy woods by a hooded horseman. Her efforts to help are stymied by her companion and mentor, Frau Katrina Liebner, who warns against questioning the many secrets at the castle, which include insanity, mysterious deaths and rumor of werewolves. Desperate for work because of a scandal in her background, Elizabeth assumes her duties without complaint but is unable to restrain her curiosity. Soon she's entangled with the intimidating master of the house, Nikolas von Wolfram. Simpson (<i>Absentee Heart</i>) peoples the castle with distinctive characters, though at times they act carelessly or foolishly (e.g., the hero fails to tie up a murderer before leaving him alone) in order to keep tension high. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Leaving a blemished reputation behind in England, Elizabeth travels to Germany to take a post as governess in Wolfram Castle. Her bold nature and insatiable curiosity have led to her downfall, and she's determined not to repeat her mistakes. However, it's soon evident that disturbing emotional torrents run deep in the Wolfram family, and whispers of magic and werewolves make her vow to temper her curiosity difficult, while the way the enigmatic lord of the castle challenges her spirit and quickens her pulse makes controlling her audacious streak impossible. Simpson's latest is a treat for lovers of gothic romance and a welcome offering for readers looking for European adventures beyond the British Isles. There's a natural progression here from the traditional gothic of eerie occurrences with rational explanations to a true paranormal twist, and Simpson keeps the sultry sensuality at a strong simmer. <i>Nina Davis</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

For Westerners working with Eastern teachers, the difficulties can be compounded by cultural differences, language barriers, and divergent expectations. <i>Wise Teacher, Wise Student </i>examines the teacher-student relationship as it is understood in the Tibetan Buddhist context. The author surveys a wide spectrum of situations, exploring the causes of potential pitfalls. In illuminating the sources of misunderstandings, he offers methods to heal wounds and encourage healthy relationships.</p><p>Alexander Berzin received a PhD from Harvard University in 1972 from the Departments of Far Eastern Languages and Sanskrit and Indian Studies.

(Ven. Thubten Chodron, author of Buddhism for Beginners )</p><p> Alex Berzin's work is the first serious attempt to write a comprehensive study of the issues involved in the student-teacher relationship in Buddhism.

When the Branch Davidian compound in Waco caught fire, when a terrorist-flown plane crashed into the Pentagon, and when mass graves were uncovered in Croatia, the authorities called Owsley. Through cutting-edge science, instinctive artistry, and dogged tenacity, Owsley painstakingly rebuilds the skeleton, and helps identify it and determine the cause of death.</p><p>A curator for the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History, Doug Owsley has handled over ten thousand human skeletons, more than anyone else in America. He has worked with America's historic skeletons, from, colonial Jamestown burials to Plains Indians to Civil War soldiers to skeletons tens of thousands of years old.</p><p>That includes the Kennewick Man, a 9,600-year-old human skeleton found in shallow water along the banks of Washington State's Columbia River. It was a skeleton that would turn Owsley's life upside down.</p><p>Days before Owsley was scheduled to begin studying the skeleton, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seized it and announced they would repatriate Kennewick Man, burying his bones on the land of the Native American tribes who claimed him. Along with seven of America's leading scientists, Owsley sued the U.S. government over custody. At stake was a wide body of knowledge about our past and our history that would be lost forever if the bones were reburied. For six years, Owsley fought a legal and political battle that put everything at risk, jeopardizing his career and his reputation.</p></p><p>Dr. Douglas Owsley, curator for the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and forensic scientist "reads bones like most people read books." He also gains as much knowledge from them. In <i>No Bone Unturned: The Adventures of the Smithsonian's Top Forensic Scientist and the Legal Battle for America's Oldest Skeletons</i>, Jeff Benedict presents a double story: a sensitive portrait of this extraordinary scientist and a thorough reporting of the landmark 1996 lawsuit, <i>Robson Bonnichsen et al v. U.S. et al.</i> Benedict admits that his initial plan was to focus on the lawsuit, in which a group of scientists sued the federal government for the right to study the remains of 9,600 year-old Kennewick Man--the oldest complete human skeleton to be found in America and claimed by the Umatilla Native American tribe for reburial, but shifted his focus after hearing about Owsley. The result is a fascinating account of how one man's commitment to science and knowledge could help rewrite North American human history. <p></p><p> Owsley is among the country's leading authorities in skeletal research and physical/forensic anthropology. In addition to curating the Smithsonian's vast Native American skeletal collection, he has assisted various government agencies to identify remains in historic cases ranging from the war in Bosnia and Waco to September 11. By reviewing Owsley's input in these cases, Benedict shows how his involvement in (and impact on) the Kennewick man case is a logical outgrowth of his professional standing and brilliance. Part detective story, part thriller, the lawsuit at the heart <i>No Bone Unturned</i> provides captivating reading. Benedict tells this high-stakes story, replete with legal twists and high-powered political maneuvering, clearly and dynamically. One might think that a story about a scientist and a lawsuit could be, well, as dry as the bones Owsley studies. Far from it--<i>No Bone Unturned</i> makes the case for donning a lab coat and fighting the good fight. --<i>Silvana Tropea</i></p><p>Jeff Benedict conducted the first national study on sexual assault and athletes. He has published three books on athletes and crime, including a blistering expos� on the NFL, <em>Pros and Cons: The Criminals Who Play in the NFL</em>, and <em>Public Heroes, Private Felons: Athletes and Crimes Against Women</em>.

While Furio did not intend to write a book when she first started writing to over 50 incarcerated and convicted killers, the responses she received from them were so fascinating and illuminating, she realized that she could not keep them to herself. She saw that these highly candid first-hand accounts revealed more about the inner workings of the minds of these criminals than anything she could say herself. Without question the first book about serial killers that is written by serial killers, this volume offers an entirely unique perspective on this most complex criminal and gives us a rare and intimate look into the minds of men responsible for some of the most heinous serial killings in recent history. This is the first time material of this kind has ever been made available. Each chapter, one for each killer, begins with a brief background and then the letters Furio received are transcribed and reproduced, exactly as they were written--unedited and uncensored. Admittedly, some of this is very chilling and disturbing reading. There are detailed descriptions of the atrocious crimes they committed (or vehemently claim they didn&#39;t commit), the depraved and sad lives they lived, their childhoods, their wives, their victims, their sexual preferences. Also included are many rare, never-before-seen crime scene and family photographs, artwork, reproductions of many of the actual letters and poems and other interesting documents. The book includes letters from Randall Woodfield, aka the I-5 killer, Robin Gecht and Edward Spreitzer of the Chicago Rippers, the prophetically named David Gore, Henry Lee Lucas, Harvy Carignan, Lawrence Bittaker, Roy Norris, Harrison T. Graham of Philadelphia, Jeff Libby, Douglas Clark and Bill Suff. The first book to provide case studies of this kind of criminal in the form of personal letters, The Serial Killer Letters is a major and pioneering addition to the psychological literature on serial killers and their crimes. By offering the actual words of the killers themselves, this book offers readers the opportunity to come to their own conclusions about what kind of people these men really are, what makes them tick and what turned them into human killing machines in the first place. In addition to true crime buffs, a wide variety of disciplines and professionals, including psychologists, criminologists, profilers, forensic psychologists, police and corrections personnel, will be grateful to have this unique opportunity to get an inside look at these most complex individuals.</p><p></p><h2>Blind Ambition: The End of the Story</h2><p>In reissuing Blind Ambition, which spent six months on the New York Times bestseller list and has been out of print for over two decades, author John Dean has added a powerful new Afterword, an extended essay in which he explains with the new clarity why (and how) a bungled, conspicuously amateurish burglary at the Democratic National Committee unraveled a presidency, forcing Richard Nixon from office; he also provides definitive answers to the most persistent questions that have lingered about these events; and alerts us all to the deceitful and growing efforts by Nixon apologists and those out to make a fast buck to rewrite this tragic chapter of American history by reinventing it. Just as with Blind Ambition, this new material is brutally honest and strikingly revealing. Dean s perceptive new Afterword, when read with this now classic autobiographical work, truly closes the case on Watergate.</p><p>&#x201c;...John W. Dean, who has gained his understanding of the past through unsparing honesty, defends history itself from the charlatans and quacks who would distort it."

He offers a unique accounting of the events and his own role in them.&#x201d; Stanley Kutler, historian and author of The Wars of Watergate &amp; Abuse of Power: The New Nixon TapesJohn W.

Over the years, he has become one of the nation s most respected political commentators and has written extensively on law, government and politics. Before becoming White House Counsel in July 1970 at age thirty-one, Dean was Chief Minority Counsel to the Judiciary Committee of the United States House of Representatives, the Associate Director of a law reform commission, and Associate Deputy Attorney General of the United States. He served as Nixon&#39;s White House lawyer for a thousand days.

Like the old fairy tales it must be told and told again, for it is touched with enchantment. Placing his hero&#39;s legendary history in the reign of Richard I of England. Roger Lancelyn Green has used as his sources the ballads, romances and plays, as well as the literary retellings of Noyes, Tennyson, Peacock and Scott. In this literary mosiac he has brought to life a character who is the archetypal outlaw and popular champion of the poor. Walter Crane, one of the masters of children&#39;s book illustration, created the drawing for a retelling of the Robin Hood story by Henry Gilbert. published in 1912.</p><p>Roger Lancelyn Green was born in 1918. He loved storytelling and was fascinated by traditional fairy tales, myths and legends from around the world. His retellings include Egyptian, Greek and Norse legends, plus a retelling of Robin Hood. He died in 1987.</p><h2>A Year in the South: Four Lives in 1865</h2><p>The pivotal year in American history is revealed through the lives of four southerners--Samuel Agnew, Louis Hughes, Cornelia McDonald, and John Robertson--who provide stunning eyewitness accounts of some of the most important events in the American story.</p><p>Stephen V. Ash's remarkable <i>A Year in the South</i> is a multifaceted biography of four "ordinary people in an extraordinary time." The year is 1865. The four are a 32-year-old mulatto slave in Alabama; a 42-year-old Virginian who has lost both her husband and her home; an 18-year-old East Tennessee farm boy (a Confederate forced to pledge allegiance to the United States); and a 31-year-old Mississippi minister. After a succinct prologue, which follows the four up to 1865, Ash, with quiet elegance, limns his characters lives chronologically through the year, each character appearing sequentially in four chapters linked to the seasons. A brief epilogue traces the postwar lives of the four. Interestingly, all lived to see the beginning of the 20th century. It is difficult to overstate the achievement of this book: by focusing on the quotidian struggles of these unsung refugees--for that is what, in many ways, they were--in their new and forever-changed land, and by his wise refusal to succumb to either regional ruefulness or political pedantry, Ash has painted vivid, telling portraits. By way of his skillful, evenhanded narrative, the unknown blossoms into the memorable. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i><b>Stephen V. Ash</b> is Associate Professor of History at the University of Tennessee. He is the author of several books on the Civil War, including <i>When the Yankees Came: Conflict </i>and <i>Chaos in the Occupied South, 1861-1865</i>.<br></p><h2>The Maid of the White Hands (Tristan and Isolde Novels, Book 2)</h2><p>Isolde&#x2019;s day has come. In Ireland her mother, the Queen, lies dying. The throne of the Emerald Isle, one of the last strongholds of the Goddess, awaits her. But while Ireland is her destiny, Isolde is already Queen of Cornwall, trapped in a loveless marriage to the mean-spirited King Mark. Her true love is his nephew, Tristan of Lyonesse, who has never married, remaining faithful to Isolde.<br><br>Across the sea in France, a young princess who shares Isolde&#x2019;s name enters the story. King Hoel named his daughter in honor of Isolde of Ireland, but young Isolde of France has always been determined to outdo Queen Isolde. She, too, is a physician and is called &#x201c;Blanche Mains,&#x201d; for her white hands and healing touch. Blanche is of an age to be married, and she has chosen her husband&#x2014;Tristan of Lyonesse. Her father objects, but fate favors Blanche. King Mark has become suspicious of his wife and nephew, and when Tristan is wounded in battle, he sees a chance to separate them for good. <br><br>Mark sends Tristan to France to be healed by Blanche, who makes the most of the opportunity. Tristan&#x2019;s letters to Isolde are intercepted, and he is told that she has given him up. Near death from his wounds, Tristan sends one last desperate letter to Isolde by a trusted servant. He is dying, he tells her, and asks for one final sign of their love. If she can forgive him for marrying another, she must come to France in a ship set with white sails. If the ship&#x2019;s sails are black, he will know that she no longer loves him. Isolde immediately leaves for France, but when Blanche sees the white sails from the castle window, she pulls the curtains and tells Tristan that they are black. To her horror, he turns his face to the wall and dies.<br><br>There ends the traditional medieval story of Tristan and Isolde&#x2014;with betrayal, death, and grief. But the original Irish legend ends differently, and so does this book, with magic and drama as only Rosalind Miles can write it.</p><p>Rosalind Miles is the author of the bestselling Guenevere trilogy, as well as the Tristan and Isolde trilogy and <i>I, Elizabeth</i>. A well-known and critically acclaimed novelist, essayist, and broadcaster, she lives in England.CHAPTER 1<br><br>The worst of the winter storms lashed the Western Isle. Raging seas beat on the ancient citadel of Dubh Lein and the night-riding demons howled through the sky overhead. But in the Queen's Chamber the air was hushed and still.<br><br>One tall candle lit the figure on the bed. Her white silk shift gleamed in the torchlight shining from the walls, and on her hand she wore the ancient ring of Queens. Beneath the billowing blood-red canopy, the long elegant body and strong face were as beautiful as ever they had been in her life. But the skin had the pallor of oncoming death, and the long henna-colored hair streamed out on the pillows as if the sleeper had already been laid to rest in the quiet earth.<br><br>A low fire burned sadly on the hearth, and standing braziers warmed the far corners of the room. Moving to and fro on silent feet, the Queen's women fed the glowing coals with sweet herbs, rosemary, thyme, and rue. They took care not to disturb the tall, hawk-faced old man watching by the bed. Imposing as he was, after so many long hours and days he was part of the sickroom now.<br><br>Hovering by the door, the youngest of the maids wept and wrung her hands. "She should be in the infirmary. That's the place to die."<br><br>"Hush, child."<br><br>The chief attendant placed a comforting finger on the girl's trembling lips. "All the Queens of Ireland die in this bed. Her mother and her mother's mother went from here to the Otherworld. As Queen Isolde will, when her time comes."<br><br>Isolde . . . <br><br>A sudden gust of wind stirred the shadows in the room. Clustered around the walls, countless swan lamps flickered and danced, each tiny flame sheltered by upreared wings. The warm light played over the crimson hangings of the bed, the low gnarled ceiling, and the cream-washed walls, and lingered lovingly on the still watcher keeping his solitary vigil in the shining gloom.<br><br>"Young Queen Isolde?" The little maid's tearstained face lit with the memory of a merry laugh and a cloud of glowing hair. "She'll be coming back now, won't she? She'll be our next Queen?" Her eyes moved uncertainly to the still figure in the bed. "If . . . ?"<br><br>"When the Queen dies, yes," said the older woman with soft certainty. "Ireland has always obeyed the Mother-right. The throne has passed from mother to daughter since time was born. Isolde will be Queen."<br><br>Fools! How could they be so sure?<br><br>The hooded figure standing beside the bed wrinkled his lips in a savage snarl. Didn't they hear the booted feet below, the clink of spurs, the rattling of swords? Didn't they know that the wolves were already gathering, drawn by the scent of blood? He looked down. Why, even the unconscious woman lying here knew that her knights and lords had come to carve up her kingdom before she had breathed her last.<br><br>And before her rightful heir could return to claim her throne. The old man gave another silent snarl. How many ages had the throne of the Western Isle passed down from mother to daughter in the line of queens? Yet every rising generation was at the mercy of rapacious men. He raised his eyes to the ceiling in a furious prayer. Hurry, Isolde, hurry, or you will come too late!<br>In the chamber below, the young knight leaned back and looked around with a challenging stare.<br><br>"She's our next Queen, you say. Tell us then, Gilhan, why isn't she here?"<br><br>The knight at the head of the table smiled thinly and eyed the speaker as coldly as he dared. So Breccan was already questioning Isolde's right to the throne? This was going to be worse than he thought.<br><br>"Rest assured, Sir Breccan," he said with elaborate courtesy, "Queen Isolde will be with us soon."<br><br>"She's still in Camelot with the High King and Queen?"<br><br>Gilhan nodded. "Visiting on behalf of her husband, King Mark."<br><br>"But has she been sent for?" Breccan's hard gaze fastened on Gilhan. "Does she know that the old Queen's dying--that you're ready to make her our Queen?"<br><br>Gilhan felt a strong tremor of unease.<br><br>"Not yet," he replied calmly, schooling himself to ignore Breccan's predatory air and the equally hard-faced men seated on either side. Breccan's knights were already feared throughout Dubh Lein. No one would be surprised if their master seized the chance to advance himself and them.<br><br>"I'll send to her now." Breccan nodded to the tallest of his knights. "You'll go, Ravigel." He turned back to Gilhan. "He's the best man I've got."<br><br>"Not so, Sir Breccan," said Gilhan silkily. "I am Lord of the Council. I shall send word." Swiftly he reviewed the assembled company with growing doubt. Who could he count on? Who would support him here?<br><br>He did not need to look at the dark, brooding figure on his left, staring at Breccan as if he were a scorpion, to know that this man at least was loyal to the rule of Queens. Ireland had been the Sacred Island of the Druids as far back as any man could count. As Chief of the Druids in the Western Isle, Cormac would defend the Mother-right to the death.<br><br>But the Queen had rarely summoned Cormac to court. When she sought his mystical wisdom, she traveled to the Druids' secret grove, a world away. Gilhan suppressed a sigh. Cormac's life in the green heart of the forest, a living world of sweetness, faith, and trust, was a poor preparation for the false smiles and hidden knives at court.<br><br>Who else was there? Gilhan glanced around the long table with a sinking heart. The dying Queen had been a creature of fierce and fleeting passions, governed by her body's every whim. Too many of these men had been her lover, some for one night alone, and all of them discarded sooner or later for another man. Hardly the way, Gilhan reflected grimly, to secure their loyalty now.<br><br>And others, however faithful in the past, would run with the pack to greet the rising sun. Take Vaindor, thought Gilhan with dry disdain, watching an imposing older knight smiling with approval on Breccan and his band. It was a long time since Vaindor, one of the Queen's former champions, had played any significant role at the court of Dubh Lein. Breccan had only to flatter Vaindor's arrogance and the knight would be his for life. Others too could be easily influenced. Take old Doneal there, restlessly drumming his battle-scarred fingers on the table: if Breccan offered him the smell of blood and the excitement of a raid, he'd leap at the chance to swing a sword again.<br><br>Indeed, after the long, dull years of the Queen's decline, most of them would rally behind a leader who offered them war, when all the country wanted was peace. Gods above, Gilhan lamented inwardly, where are the men of strength and honor we used to have? Where are the older knights whom the Queen in her excesses drove away? Even one of them now would be worth his weight in gold--old Fideal, say, or any of her former champions, who in her younger days had loved her more than the world. But Fideal was one of many who had gone away from court, determined to seek a simpler way of life. Who was left? Gilhan forced himself to stifle his concern. Cormac the Druid might prove to be the only ally he had.<br><br>He turned on Breccan. "Why the unseemly haste?" he said sternly. "The Queen's soul is passing into the Beyond. We are here to honor the Mother-right and prepare for Isolde's return."<br><br>Breccan smiled at him, a white show of handsome teeth. "Are we so?"<br><br>Gilhan made his voice soft and dangerous. "Do you question that?"<br><br>"Never!" Breccan widened his eyes in an innocent stare. "But some think the Mother-right is a thing of the past. They say the Romans brought in the rightful rule of men when they tossed their troublesome women off the nearest rock."<br><br>Sir Doneal's old eyes lit with reminiscent fire. "Still, our warrior queens showed the Romans a thing or two. Great battles, eh?" He chuckled. "And thousands of dead Romans piled in heaps for the crows!"<br><br>"Old days, old ways," said Gilhan forcefully. "The Romans are long gone."<br><br>Breccan hid a teasing grin. Oh, how he loved tormenting these old fools! "But the Christians are here. And where Christians rule, the days of the Queens are done."<br><br>Gilhan's face darkened. "Is this the fate you foresee for our Queens?" He paused, weighing his words. "Where's your loyalty, sir?"<br><br>"What?" Breccan's hand flew to his sword. "You dare to question my loyalty, Gilhan? When my kin have been champions of the Throne since time began?" He gestured to the knight seated on his left. "When my own brother was the Queen's last chosen one?"<br><br>"Sir Tolen, yes."<br><br>Gilhan treated the slumped figure beside Breccan to a pitiless stare. Yes, Breccan came from the island's leading clan, a long line of men chosen to be royal champions and companions of the couch, all loyal, brave, and born with a flashing charm. As the last of many men favored by Ireland's queens, Tolen had been an inevitable choice ten years ago, almost too handsome to be borne, gifted with raw sensuality and feral grace.<br><br>But the horizontal hours and self-indulgent years had taken their toll. How had this bloated, red-faced ruin of a man ever graced the Queen's bed? And how must Breccan resent his older brother's favored place with the Queen, when he, younger, fitter, faster, bolder, and hungrier, was forced to prowl the wilderness beyond the gates, barred from the enchanted place of love and power?<br><br>Tolen felt their gaze and stirred. "What?"<br><br>"It's nothing, Tolen. Nothing to do with you," snapped Breccan. "Now Gilhan, about the Queen . . ."<br><br>Gilhan sat very still. A fearful vision of the future unfolded before his eyes. He saw a world without the rule of Queens, where chosen ones like Tolen could be treated with contempt. Where Breccan and his kind showed that might was right, and lesser creatures struggled to survive. But what would he do with Isolde? Could Breccan be thinking of making himself the new Queen's champion and chosen one, her companion of bed and sword? By force if need be, if Isolde would not consent? And if she disdained his advances, could her days be numbered too?<br><br>Gilhan watched Breccan's brutal features rearrange themselves in a wide, honest smile.<br><br>"Come now, let's pull together," said Breccan easily. "No more hard words. You know you can trust me, Gilhan."<br><br>Gilhan nodded and returned the smile. On the contrary, sir, you've just told me why I can't.<br>The wind swept around the castle and knocked on its windows and walls. On the shore below, the ebbing sea sang with a soft, withdrawing roar. Waiting in the shadow of the great bed, one of the Queen's women began a low lament.<br><br>At the still center of the chamber the long white figure on the bed stirred and opened her eyes. "Merlin?"<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>"You hear the wind and the sea?"<br><br>Merlin leaned forward. "What else?"<br><br>"The Lady has sent her messengers to take me home. I shall leave on this tide."<br><br>The old enchanter felt his flesh stirring as it always did to the sound of her rich, husky voice.<br><br>"All life returns to the sea, where it began," he said somberly. "Your chosen one, Sir Tolen, is keeping a vigil below. He prays to see you once to kiss your hand."<br><br>She gave a soft laugh like an otter's bark. "My chosen one now is the Dark Lord, Penn Annwyn."<br><br>"You will not admit Sir Tolen?"<br><br>"Tell him I blessed him with my dying breath." The lovely head on the pillow moved to and fro. "Is Isolde here?"<br><br>"Not yet."<br><br>She shifted fretfully. "She cannot come in time."<br><br>"In time for what?"<br><br>A low, throaty chuckle came from the bed. "Don't play with me, old fox. You yourself could not get here from Cornwall before I go to join the Old Ones on their shining thrones."<br><br>Only the highest place for her in the world beyond the worlds, Merlin noted: always a queen. He suppressed a smile. "What is your word for Isolde when she comes?"<br><br>Darkness clouded her face. "Did I wrong her, Merlin? Should I have given up the throne and made her Queen?"<br><br>The old enchanter considered. "No," he said softly at last. "She never wanted to be Queen before you died."<br><br>The Queen's long white fingers fretted at the cover of the bed. "But I told her I would hand over the kingdom, years ago&#x2014;give over the rule to her and withdraw--"<br><br>Merlin shook his head. "You are the Sovereignty, the spirit of the land. She knew it was not in your power to divorce yourself from that."<br><br>"My power, yesss&#x2014;"<br><br>He felt the force of the Queen's burning stare.<br><br>"&#x2014;which Isolde must have after me," she hissed, her eyes never leaving his face. "Swear to me, Merlin, you will&#x2014;" She broke off and gasped for breath.<br><br>"I know what you would say," he said gently. "And I swear."<br><br>The Queen's fingers wandered over the coverlet to the ring on her left hand and drew it off.<br><br>"For Isolde," she commanded with a joyful smile. "And only for her."</p><h2>The Art of Frank C.

The very name of the sandwich reveals how to make it, and the classic combination of bread, bacon, lettuce and tomato needs no alteration or addition to satisfy.

She offers 60 variations in soup, pasta, and even strudel form, such as Bacon, Leek, and Tomato Strudel and Pasta Salad with Bacon, Tomatoes, and Bocconcini (little balls of mozzarella that lend a delicious chewiness to the proceedings). Risking charges of heresy, Jordan even gives the recipe for a vegetarian VLT, which calls for crisp-fried leeks instead of bacon. It's surprisingly tempting. And while this cookbook doesn't contain much else to entice a vegetarian, it does offer much to please anyone who enjoys bacon, tomatoes and lettuce-in every possible incarnation. Also included are recipes for mayonnaise, aoli and other appropriate condiments. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Techno Priests - Book 3 - Planeta Games</h2><p>This book makes an interesting read</p><p></p><h2>Is Your Mama a Llama?</h2><p>Lloyd, the young llama, discovers what kind of animal his mama really is.</p><p>The board book version of this popular recitation of animal characteristics is equally as delightful as other editions, with one key improvement: it's inedible.

Women simply didn't ride motorcycles in 1941, but at the urging of her older brother, a very reluctant Gloria gave it a try, and it changed her life forever. She has been riding ever since, and at age 89, still rides regularly and continues to participate in cross country rides.<p>As you might expect, any woman regularly riding a motorcycle in an era when women didn't ride motorcycles has a lot of stories to tell. In <i>Gloria Struck: 75 years on Two Wheels and Still Riding</i>, Gloria shares with you all of her favorite stories, from back when she was being raised behind her father's motorcycle shop in Clifton NJ, through 75 years of riding tales, all the way to the present, where she is rightfully celebrated at motorcycles rallies and events. Complementing her life and riding stories is an extensive scrapbook of photos, over 100 of which are included in this autobiography. Also included are anecdotes provided by fans, friends and admirers. </p><p>Of course, Gloria's book and her stories, are as much about overcoming prejudice and personal obstacles, as it is about riding motorcycles. Because of that, this book resonates with riders and non-riders alike.

That&#x2019;s how long Gloria Tramontin Struck has been riding motorcycles. Her early bikes were all Indians, followed by a Harley-Davidson Panhead that she bought after the war. More recently she&#x2019;s been seen making the yearly trip from New Jersey to Sturgis on another Harley, a Heritage Softail. During all those years Gloria has managed to ride in every U.S. state, and a number of European countries as well--and yes, she is still riding. All that riding on all those bikes means Gloria has hundreds of stories to tell, and at least as many photos that illustrate those stories. At the age of 92, she&#x2019;s collected the best of her riding history into the book you hold in your hands, 256 pages of pure Gloria--the woman who&#x2019;s already done all of the things the rest of us will only dream about.Gloria Struck began riding as at age 16. Now, at age 89, she continues to ride, and not just around the block. For the 75th Sturgis festivities Gloria did what she always does, packed her Harley-Davidson and rode from Clifton, New Jersey, to Sturgis, South Dakota. In fact, Gloria plans to ride until she's 100 years old--at least. As Gloria likes to say, "I love new challenges.... live your dreams."<p>Today, Gloria divides her time between speaking engagements, and riding, often with her daughter and/or granddaughter.</p></p><h2>Mau Mau Rebellion: The Emergency in Kenya 1952&#x2013;1956</h2><p>In The Mau Mau Rebellion, the author describes the background to and the course of a short but brutal late colonial campaign in Kenya. The Mau Mau, a violent and secretive Kikuyu society, aimed to restore the proud tribe&#x2019;s pre-colonial superiority and rule. The 1940s saw initial targeting of Africans working for the colonial government and by 1952 the situation had deteriorated so badly that a State of Emergency was declared. The plan for mass arrests leaked and many leaders and supporters escaped to the bush where the gangs formed a military structure. Brutal attacks on both whites and loyal natives caused morale problems and local police and military were overwhelmed. Reinforcements were called in, and harsh measures including mass deportation, protected camps, fines, confiscation of property and extreme intelligence gathering employed were employed. War crimes were committed by both sides.<br><br>As this well researched book demonstrates the campaign was ultimately successful militarily, politically the dye was cast and paradoxically colonial rule gave way to independence in 1956.</p><p>Nick van der Bijl BEM spent 25 years, most in the Intelligence Corps between 1970 and 1989.

The billionaire scion tied two empty gas cans to his body for floatation and swam for shore, and by most accounts, he made it. But what happened there, when he encountered members of the Asmat tribe--a culture marked by ritual violence and cannibalism--has been long debated. Did he disappear into the tropical jungles, or was he rendered and eaten by the tribesmen, as many speculated and the Rockefeller family long denied? Award-winning journalist Carl Hoffman has stepped into Rockefeller&#x2019;s boot prints and Asmat society, interviewing generations of warriors in an exhaustive and engrossing attempt to solve the mystery. The result, <em>Savage Harvest</em>, succeeds not only as a captivating and sensational puzzle, but also as a (seemingly unlikely) modern adventure and a fascinating glimpse of an anachronistic people pulled into the 20th century by the tensions of global politics. So, did he make it? The title might offer a clue. <em>--Jon Foro</em></p> Simon Winchester<br>View larger <p><b></b></p><b>Simon Winchester Reviews Savage Harvest: A Tale of Cannibals, Colonialism, and Michael Rockefeller's Tragic Quest for Primitive Art</b><p></p> <p>Carl Hoffman, who with his 2010 book The Lunatic Express demonstrated himself to be a traveler of the greatest courage and determination, as well as a writer of skill, has now made a significant contribution to history. Savage Harvest, a narrative that is as exciting as it is instructive, appears finally to have winnowed the truth from the mare&#x2019;s nest of legend and wishful thinking surrounding the disappearance in November 1961, of Michael Rockefeller, in a remote region of southwestern New Guinea.The 23-year old, along with a Dutch anthropologist colleague and two young guides, were sailing in a dugout catamaran some three miles from the coast of Asmat. The craft overturned; the two locals swam for help, but as the wreck drifted farther from land an impatient Rockefeller decided to try and make it alone. With two fuel cans to help his buoyancy on what he reckoned would be a twenty-hour swim, he slid into the warm shallows of the Arafura Sea - never to be seen by friends or family again.Did he drown? Was he eaten by a shark? Did he vanish into the jungle, Kurtz-like? Or was he the victim of cannibalism at the hands of coastal villagers? Hoffman has shown that with assiduous tradecraft, hard work and near-obsessive tenacity, it is possible to know, to solve the supposedly insoluble. He has journeyed, twice now, deep into the dark interiors of Asmat, and has conducted interviews and learned the language and listened to sensible men and women &#x2013; in New Guinea, in the Netherlands, in the anthropology departments of knowledgeable universities. And he has used a severe intelligence to determine just what happened on that warm dawn Monday, November 20, 1961.The Rockefellers &#x2013; not least Michael&#x2019;s twin sister Mary, who produced her own book two years ago &#x2013; may not want to believe this tale; and the family did nothing to help Hoffman in his admirable quest. But the truth, as this book chronicles in patient, meticulous detail, has a way of eking itself out. Savage Harvest is a remarkable testament to the revealed truth, and of its revealing - even if that truth is wholly bizarre and, to most, quite literally unpalatable.</p> <p><b></b></p><p></p> <p>Simon Winchester is the acclaimed author most recently of The Men Who United the States as well as Atlantic, The Professor and the Madman, The Man Who Loved China, A Crack in the Edge of the World, and Krakatoa, all of which were New York Times bestsellers.

Her subjects range from the story of how her own cookery writing began to accounts of some restaurants in provincial France, of white truffles in Piedmont, wild risottos on the islands of the Venetian lagoon and odd happenings during rain-drenched seaside holidays in the British Isles.

But even if they did, you wouldn't care, because of the rich store of information that David shares and the literary grace with which she imparts it.

It shows time and again the controversial, often difficult relationship between feminism and Marxism. The theoretical questions discussed include the origins of women&#x2019;s oppression, domestic labor, dual systems theory, performativity, and differentialism. Women&#x2019;s oppression is a structural element of the division of labor and one of the direct factors through which capitalism not only reinforces its ideological domination but also organizes the exploitation and reproduction of labor. The integration of patriarchal relations and capitalism has led to their radical transformation&#x2014;in the family, in terms of women&#x2019;s place in production, in sexual relations, and with respect to sexual identity. Marxism needs to probe complex processes: ongoing transformations and crises, a global context creating an increasingly feminized workforce, and changing relations between men and women. The book maintains that it is a mistake to submerge gender into class or to believe that freedom from exploitation automatically brings about women&#x2019;s liberation and the ending of sexual roles; it is equally wrong is to think the class question can be removed and gender made the main enemy.</p></p><p><p><b>Cinzia Arruzza</b> is an assistant professor of philosophy at the New School and an International Institute for Research and Education (IIRE) fellow.

Among his most important books were <i>The Devil's Dictionary</i> and <i>Tales of Soldiers and Civilians</i>.Chickamauga<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>One sunny autumn afternoon a child strayed away from its rude home in a small field and entered a forest unobserved. It was happy in a new sense of freedom from control, happy in the opportunity of exploration and adventure; for this child's spirit, in bodies of its ancestors, had for thousands of years been trained to memorable feats of discovery and conquest--victories in battles whose critical moments were centuries, whose victors' camps were cities of hewn stone. From the cradle of its race it had conquered its way through two continents and passing a great sea had penetrated a third, there to be born to war and dominion as a heritage.<br>The child was a boy aged about six years, the son of a poor planter. In his younger manhood the father had been a soldier, had fought against naked savages and followed the flag of his country into the capital of a civilized race to the far South. In the peaceful life of a planter the warrior-fire survived; once kindled, it is never extinguished. The man loved military books and pictures and the boy had understood enough to make himself a wooden sword, though even the eye of his father would hardly have known it for what it was. This weapon he now bore bravely, as became the son of an heroic race, and pausing now and again in the sunny space of the forest assumed, with some exaggeration, the postures of aggression and defense that he had been taught by the engraver's art. Made reckless by the ease with which he overcame invisible foes attempting to stay his advance, he committed the common enough military error of pushing the pursuit to a dangerous extreme, until he found himself upon the margin of a wide but shallow brook, whose rapid waters barred his direct advance against the flying foe that had crossed with illogical ease. But the intrepid victor was not to be baffled; the spirit of the race which had passed the great sea burned unconquerable in that small breast and would not be denied. Finding a place where some bowlders in the bed of the stream lay but a step or a leap apart, he made his way across and fell again upon the rear-guard of his imaginary foe, putting all to the sword.<br>Now that the battle had been won, prudence required that he withdraw to his base of operations. Alas; like many a mightier conqueror, and like one, the mightiest, he could not<br>* * *<br>curb the lust for war,<br>Nor learn that tempted Fate will leave the loftiest star.<br>* * *<br>Advancing from the bank of the creek he suddenly found himself confronted with a new and more formidable enemy: in the path that he was following, sat, bolt upright, with ears erect and paws suspended before it, a rabbit! With a startled cry the child turned and fled, he knew not in what direction, calling with inarticulate cries for his mother, weeping, stumbling, his tender skin cruelly torn by brambles, his little heart beating hard with terror--breathless, blind with tears--lost in the forest! Then, for more than an hour, he wandered with erring feet through the tangled undergrowth, till at last, overcome by fatigue, he lay down in a narrow space between two rocks, within a few yards of the stream and still grasping his toy sword, no longer a weapon but a companion, sobbed himself to sleep. The wood birds sang merrily above his head; the squirrels, whisking their bravery of tail, ran barking from tree to tree, unconscious of the pity of it, and somewhere far away was a strange, muffled thunder, as if the partridges were drumming in celebration of nature's victory over the son of her immemorial enslavers. And back at the little plantation, where white men and black were hastily searching the fields and hedges in alarm, a mother's heart was breaking for her missing child.<br>Hours passed, and then the little sleeper rose to his feet. The chill of the evening was in his limbs, the fear of the gloom in his heart. But he had rested, and he no longer wept. With some blind instinct which impelled to action he struggled through the undergrowth about him and came to a more open ground--on his right the brook, to the left a gentle acclivity studded with infrequent trees; over all, the gathering gloom of twilight. A thin, ghostly mist rose along the water. It frightened and repelled him; instead of recrossing, in the direction whence he had come, he turned his back upon it, and went forward toward the dark inclosing wood. Suddenly he saw before him a strange moving object which he took to be some large animal--a dog, a pig--he could not name it; perhaps it was a bear. He had seen pictures of bears, but knew of nothing to their discredit and had vaguely wished to meet one. But something in form or movement of this object--something in the awkwardness of its approach--told him that it was not a bear, and curiosity was stayed by fear. He stood still and as it came slowly on gained courage every moment, for he saw that at least it had not the long menacing ears of the rabbit. Possibly his impressionable mind was half conscious of something familiar in its shambling, awkward gait. Before it had approached near enough to resolve his doubts he saw that it was followed by another and another. To right and to left were many more; the whole open space about him were alive with them--all moving toward the brook.<br>They were men. They crept upon their hands and knees. They used their hands only, dragging their legs. They used their knees only, their arms hanging idle at their sides. They strove to rise to their feet but fell prone in the attempt. They did nothing naturally, and nothing alike, save only to advance foot by foot in the same direction. Singly, in pairs and in little groups, they came on through the gloom, some halting now and again while others crept slowly past them, then resuming their movement. They came by dozens and by hundreds; as far on either hand as one could see in the deepening gloom they extended and the black wood behind them appeared to be inexhaustible. The very ground seemed in motion toward the creek. Occasionally one who had paused did not again go on, but lay motionless. He was dead. Some, pausing, made strange gestures with their hands, erected their arms and lowered them again, clasped their heads; spread their palms upward, as men are sometimes seen to do in public prayer.<br>Not all of this did the child note; it is what would have been noted by an elder observer; he saw little but that these were men, yet crept like babes. Being men, they were not terrible, though unfamiliarly clad. He moved among them freely, going from one to another and peering into their faces with childish curiosity. All their faces were singularly white and many were streaked and gouted with red. Something in this--something too, perhaps, in their grotesque attitudes and movements--reminded him of the painted clown whom he had seen last summer in the circus, and he laughed as he watched them. But on and ever on they crept, these maimed and bleeding men, as heedless as he of the dramatic contrast between his laughter and their own ghastly gravity. To him it was a merry spectacle. He had seen his father's negroes creep upon their hands and knees for his amusement--had ridden them so, "making believe" they were his horses. He now approached one of these crawling figures from behind and with an agile movement mounted it astride. The man sank upon his breast, recovered, flung the small boy fiercely to the ground as an unbroken colt might have done, then turned upon him a face that lacked a lower jaw--from the upper teeth to the throat was a great red gap fringed with hanging shreds of flesh and splinters of bone. The unnatural prominence of nose, the absence of chin, the fierce eyes, gave this man the appearance of a great bird of prey crimsoned in throat and breast by the blood of its quarry. The man rose to his knees, the child to his feet. The man shook his fist at the child; the child, terrified at last, ran to a tree near by, got upon the farther side of it and took a more serious view of the situation. And so the clumsy multitude dragged itself slowly and painfully along in hideous pantomime--moved forward down the slope like a swarm of great black beetles, with never a sound of going--in silence profound, absolute.<br>Instead of darkening, the haunted landscape began to brighten. Through the belt of trees beyond the brook shone a strange red light, the trunks and branches of the trees making a black lacework against it. It struck the creeping figures and gave them monstrous shadows, which caricatured their movements on the lit grass. It fell upon their faces, touching their whiteness with a ruddy tinge, accentuating the stains with which so many of them were freaked and maculated. It sparkled on buttons and bits of metal in their clothing. Instinctively the child turned toward the growing splendor and moved down the slope with his horrible companions; in a few moments had passed the foremost of the throng--not much of a feat, considering his advantages. He placed himself in the lead, his wooden sword still in hand, and solemnly directed the march, conforming his pace to theirs and occasionally turning as if to see that his forces did not straggle. Surely such a leader never before had such a following.<br>Scattered about upon the ground now slowly narrowing by the encroachment of this awful march to water, were certain articles to which, in the leader's mind, were coupled no significant associations: an occasional blanket tightly rolled lengthwise, doubled and the ends bound together with a string; a heavy knapsack here, and there a broken rifle--such things, in short, as are found in the rear of retreating troops, the "spoor" of men flying from their hunters. Everywhere near the creek, which here had a margin of lowland, the earth was trodden into mud by the feet of men and horses. An observer of better experience in the use of his eyes would have noticed that these footprints pointed in both directions; the ground had been twice passed over--in advance and in retreat. a few hours before, these desperate, stricken men, with their more fortunate and now distant comrades, had penetrated the forest in thousands. Their successive battalions, breaking into swarms and reforming in lines, had passed the child on every side--had almost trodden on him as he slept. The rustle and murmur of their march had not awakened him. Almost within a stone's throw of where he lay they had fought a battle; but all unheard by him were the roar of the musketry, the shock of the cannon, "the thunder of the captains and the shouting." He had slept through it all, grasping his little wooden sword with perhaps a tighter clutch in unconscious sympathy with his martial environment, but as heedless of the grandeur of the struggle as the dead who had died to make the glory.<br>The fire beyond the belt of woods on the farther side of the creek, reflected to earth from the canopy of its own smoke, was now suffusing the whole landscape. It transformed the sinuous line of mist to the vapor of gold. The water gleamed with dashes of red, and red, too, were many of the stones protruding above the surface. But that was blood; the less desperately wounded had stained them in crossing. On them, too, the child now crossed with eager steps; he was going to the fire. As he stood upon the farther bank he turned about to look at the companions of his march. The advance was arriving at the creek. The stronger had already drawn themselves to the brink and plunged their faces into the flood. Three or four who lay without motion appeared to have no heads. At this the child's eyes expanded with wonder; even his hospitable understanding could not accept a phenomenon implying such vitality as that. After slaking their thirst these men had not had the strength to back away from the water, nor to keep their heads above it. They were drowned. In rear of these, the open spaces of the forest showed the leader as many formless figures of his grim command as at first; but not nearly so many were in motion. He waved his cap for their encouragement and smilingly pointed with his weapon in the direction of the guiding light--a pillar of fire to this strange exodus.<br>Confident of the fidelity of his forces, he now entered the belt of woods, passed through it easily in the red illumination, climbed a fence, ran across a field, turning now and again to coquet with his responsive shadow, and so approached the blazing ruin of a dwelling. Desolation everywhere! In all the wide glare not a living thing was visible. He cared nothing for that; the spectacle pleased, and he danced with glee in imitation of the wavering flames. He ran about, collecting fuel, but every object that he found was too heavy for him to cast in from the distance to which the heat limited his approach. In despair he flung in his sword--a surrender to the superior forces of nature. His military career was at an end.<br>Shifting his position, his eyes fell upon some out-buildings which had an oddly familiar appearance, as if he had dreamed of them. He stood considering them with wonder, when suddenly the entire plantation, with its inclosing forest, seemed to turn as if upon a pivot. His little world swung half around; the points of the compass were reversed. He recognized the blazing building as his own home!<br>For a moment he stood stupefied by the power of the revelation, then ran with stumbling feet, making a half-circuit of the ruin. There, conspicuous in the light of the conflagration, lay the dead body of a woman--the white face turned upward, the hands thrown out and clutched full of grass, the clothing deranged, the long dark hair in tangles and full of clotted blood. The greater part of the forehead was torn away, and from the jagged hole the brain protruded, overflowing the temple, a frothy mass of gray, crowned with clusters of crimson bubbles--the work of a shell.<br>The child moved his little hands, making wild, uncertain gestures. He uttered a series of inarticulate and indescribable cries--something between the chattering of an ape and the gobbling of a turkey--a startling, soulless, unholy sound, the language of a devil. The child was a deaf mute.<br>Then he stood motionless, with quivering lips, looking down upon the wreck.<br>&nbsp;<br>Introduction, afterword, and story selection copyright � 2002 by Brian M.

[From Introduction] In the late 60&#39;s when l began to work with &#34;non silver&#34; materials, information and good examples were scarce. I was a painting graduate student with an interest in mixing processes including photography, printmaking, sculpture, drawing and painting. My formal training in photography had been basic black and white printing. Other processes were learned slowly by watching, reading anything available, and asking questions. Often because I had no clear directions to follow or was not given a demonstration, I broke the rules. At best, exciting discoveries were made this way...at worst, time and effort produced no physical results. Such experimentation is one sure way to learn the limitations of materials and one&#39;s patience...The material in this handbook has been the basis of the workshops that l have given all over the USA for the past seven years...Because I cannot give you actual demonstrations. I have tried to make the basic steps as clear as possible. In the book you will find comparisons of the processes and Practical suggestions. I have also listed further reading, materials and products that you might find helpful. Some of the processes are covered in extensive detail in other guidebooks.</p><p></p><h2>The Descent of Man: The Concise Edition</h2><p><b>The most accessible edition ever published of Darwin?s incendiary classic, edited by ?as fine a science essayist as we have? (<i>New York Times</i>)</b> <br><br> <i>The Descent of Man</i>, Darwin?s second landmark work on evolutionary theory (following <i>The Origin of the Species</i>), marked a turning point in the history of science with its modern vision of human nature as the product of evolution. Darwin argued that the noblest features of humans, such as language and morality, were the result of the same natural processes that produced iris petals and scorpion tails. <br><br> To convey the revolutionary importance of this groundbreaking book, renowned evolutionary science writer Carl Zimmer edited this special abridged edition?made up of nine excerpts, each one representing one of Darwin?s major themes?and wrote illuminating introductions to each section, as well as an overall introduction. Zimmer brilliantly places Darwin?s basic ideas in the context of the current understanding of human nature and twenty-first-century DNA research. By accessibly presenting Darwin?s thinking to a modern readership, Zimmer eloquently demonstrates Darwin?s ever-increasing relevance and amazing scientific insight.</p><p><b>Charles Darwin</b>, a Victorian scientist and naturalist, has become one of the most famous figures of science to date. Born in 1809 to an upper-middle-class medical family, he was destined for a career in either medicine or the Anglican Church. However, he never completed his medical education and his future changed entirely in 1831 when he joined HMS Beagle as a self-financing, independent naturalist. On returning to England in 1836 he began to write up his theories and observations which culminated in a series of books, most famously <i>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</i> in 1859, where he challenged and contradicted contemporary biological and religious beliefs with two decades worth of scientific investigation and theory. Darwin's theory of natural selection is now the most widely accepted scientific model of how species evolve. He died in 1882 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. <br><br><b> Damien Hirst</b> is an internationally renowned English artist, who has dominated the art scene in England since the 1990s. Known in particular for his series of works on death, Hirst here provides a contemporary, visual take on Darwin's theory of evolution - the struggle between life and death in nature. <br><br><b> William Bynum</b> is Professor Emeritus of the History of Medicine at University College, London, and was for many years Head of the Academic Unit of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine. He edited the scholarly journal <i>Medical History</i> from 1980 to 2001, and his previous publications include<i> Science and the Practice of Medicine in the Nineteenth Century</i>; <i>The Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine</i> (co-edited with Roy Porter);<i> The Oxford Dictionary of Scientific Quotations</i> (with Roy Porter),<i> The Dictionary of Medical Biography</i> (with Helen Bynum), and <i>History of Medicine: A Very Short Introduction</i>.

Prum, in <i>The Evolution of Beauty</i></b></p><h2>Donne: The Reformed Soul</h2><p>John Stubbs&#39;s Donne: the Reformed Soul brings one of Britain&#39;s most famous poets - and famous periods in history - to life.John Donne&#39;s life story is inextricably tied up with the fabric of a society in the throes of religious persecution. His family had long been subject to the terror inflicted upon Catholics under the reign of Elizabeth I, and while his brother languished in prison, and his mother and uncles fled to exile in Europe, Donne was consumed by the question of his own faith and by trying to figure out what it is that connects human beings - and keeps them apart.In his biography of Donne, John Stubbs chronicles not only a long and bitter sectarian conflict, but also the love story of a young couple who broke the rules of their society, and paid the ultimate price.From the raucous streets of late sixteenth-century London to the personal and political intrigues of Donne&#39;s family and public life, from the horrors of the Reformation to the delight of Donne&#39;s poetry, John Stubbs&#39; book is a vivid, dazzling biography of an extraordinary man, as well as a compelling portrait of England at a time of bewildering transformation.&#39;Magnificent . . . remarkable&#39;Daily Telegraph&#39;Impressive . . .

She was brought up in Wimbledon and, following a Biochemistry Degree from Oxford, she became a partner in a big City law firm. She gave up the City to follow her long-held dream of becoming a writer. She is the author of the brilliantly successful children&#39;s series, THE CHRONICLES OF ANCIENT DARKNESS. DARK MATTER is her first adult ghost story. It arises from her lifelong love of the Arctic, which has taken her to northern Canada, Greenland, Scandinavia and Spitsbergen.Paver is superb at describing the Himalayan landscape...This is a finely wrought example of the classic, Jamesian ghost story...made extra special and disturbing by the bleak, wintery setting. -- Peter Tennant * BLACK STATIC * Michelle Paver is one of my favourite writers at the moment...Terrify your loved ones this Christmas with some of Paver's best * STARBURST * Paver constructs her narrative expertly. The human drama is engaging, while the scares are unfurled slowly but surely, to chilling effect. * CATHOLIC HERALD * This book is guaranteed to give you chills! Don't read it just before going to bed... * MARTIN BELCHER blog * Atmospheric * TIMES LITERARY SUPPLEMENT * This one is a cracker * DAILY TELEGRAPH * Terror on a grander scale -- Andrew Michael Hurley * THE GUARDIAN * The book transports the reader into cold, inimical terrain, forcing them to question the evidence of their over-stimulated senses * METRO * Paver's elegantly crafted ghost story holds you in a vice-tight grip until the end...Thin Air is an edge-of-your-seat reading experience that will leave your frosty-fingered and shivering as you hurriedly leaf through its pages to reach its startling climax -- Katherine McLaughlin * SCI FI NOW * After finding herself mesmerised by the history, vastness and the terrifying solitude of the Himalayas, Michelle Paver uses it as the setting for this undeniably gripping account of a 1935 expedition up Kangchenjunga...Step in with excitement, yet the greatest of caution... * ABERDEEN PRESS &amp; JOURNAL * This is a slim book, and a simple story, but it has all the elegance of a classic ghost story -- Miriam McDonald * SFX * I cannot recommend this book enough. If you enjoyed Michelle's previous ghost story, Dark Matter, you'll love this one. If you love anything supernatural, a bit scary, ghostly, then you'll enjoy it too. It's a fantastic read thats absorbing and totally paralysing. Beautifully, lyrically written. A five star read if ever there was one! * EMPIRE OF BOOKS * If you've read Michelle Paver's previous ghost story Dark Matter, you'll know how well she can build a creepy, unsettling atmosphere - and she's done it again here, in a very different environment. I for one couldn't put the story down but needed to read on to the final resolution before trying to sleep! * OUR BOOK REVIEWS ON LINE * The first thing that impressed me was the sustained recreation of the 1930s: male camaraderie and old pals. It is linguistically perfect, since you completely believe in the characters and hte mindsets of this group of climbers. The research is thorough and the descriptions so rich that you can imagine every step on the ice and rocks and every nuance of creating the base camps and additional camps during the ascent. * NUDGE * If you have ever wanted to climb a mountain or to have some sort of insight into the preparation both mentally and physically, of the extreme effort it takes to even attempt something like this, then this is the book for you. * THE BOOK TRAIL * And my enjoyment and shiver mounted with the appearance of the terrifying object, deployed so brilliantly in one of the best and most shivery 'ghosts' I have ever read - W.W. Jacobs' The Monkey's Paw. Paver has an object, and I whimpered anxiously as it brought the added accretion of my memory of Jacobs' story into the room. * LADY FANCIFULL * A clever, chilling, compelling read -- Katherine Sunderland * BIBLIOMANIAC * This book was both a fantastic description of the majesty of the Himalayas and a wonderfully creepy ghost story. In equal measures it showed why some are irresistibly drawn to these mountains and why, possibly, they shouldn't be. This would be a great read for Halloween (but make sure you know exactly where you left your rucksack...) * JANE &amp; BEX BOOK BLOG * While comparable to Dark Matter, this is I think very much the better book - in a way which I can't explain in detail, the ecology of its horror is much more complete: while lacking none of the horror of the other book, it is all more satisfying. * BLUE BOOK BALLOON * It is rich in atmosphere, the environment stunningly described. Kangchenjunga is a formidable character in its own right and it is a deadly one. but it is also such a satisfying ghost story, so perfect for these darker evenings, and it is wrapped within a beautifully told and sad tale. Thin Air succeeds as an excellent ghost story and horror novel but it is also a wonderful piece of historical fiction and I thoroughly recommend it. * FOR WINTER NIGHTS blog * I loved her previous ghost/terror novel, Dark Matter. This is similar, the tension tightens slowly, with the turn of every page, until you cannot put the book down. * SANDRA DANBY BLOG * Thin Air is a wonderfully evocative and creepy story but it's more than that - it's a capturing of the awe of nature, the exhilaration of climbing and of a time during British colonialism which combined some noble endeavours but also an awful lot of ignoble behaviour. Of course, of course, of course, I recommend Thin Air to you. * THE BOOK BAG * I was surprised and delighted to find this an utterly absorbing tale that I think I would have read in one sitting regardless as once I began I didn't want to put it down * BOOKPHACE * A hauntingly, spine chilling epic of a book! * MRS BLOGS BOOKS * The scariest part of the story for me was the bit with the rucksack. I think the hair on the back of my neck stood up. Very macabre and creepy * THE BOOK REST * There's just something about the bleakness, the sheer depth of the isolation and the unfamiliarity of this terrain to me that I love in this book. Put that alongside the fact that it's a mix of psychological thriller and ghost story , and you've got a winner. * REBEL ANGEL blog * A ghost story to chill and thrill...Like Touching the Void rewritten by Jack London, Thin Air is a heart-freezing masterpiece. -- Amanda Craig * THE OBSERVER * Paver's descriptions of the isolated and intimidating landscape create an eerie, unsettling atmosphere that gets under your skin * DAILY EXPRESS * This haunting new novel and long-awaited sequel to the chilling Dark Matter certainly doesn't disappoint. The plot of Thin Air is undeniably gripping and a genuine page-turner. After finding herself mesmerised by the history, vastness and the terrifying solitude of the Himalayas, Paver used it as the setting for this undeniably gripping account of a 1935 expedition up Kangchenjunga. -- Kate Whiting * GLASGOW HERALD * Chilling in every sense -- Violet Hudson * MAIL ON SUNDAY * Michelle Paver's descriptions of Himalayan mountain-climbing are terrifyingly lifelike - the lashing winds, glittering ice: you can see it all...Paver's style is lively and clear; and the tale just rips along...Just fantastic -- Wendy Holden * DAILY MAIL * Spellbindingly creepy -- Eithne Farry * SUNDAY EXPRESS * There are no obvious shocks here but instead a sustained creeping dread as the likelihood increases that it's not all in Pearce's mind and that they are heading for tragedy just like Lyell and company. Subtitled 'A Ghost Story', this is very much the classic approach, concentrating on mood and subtllety to create chills in the reader. -- James Evans * STARBURST * This vivid ghost story reads like a classic * SUNDAY MIRROR * Looking for a proper ghost story? Thin Air is a creepy, compelling tale of a Himalayan climbing expedition, where strange events on the mountain stir dread and panic. * GOOD HOUSEKEEPING * A wonderfully atmospheric and hugely enjoyable ghost story -- Anthony Horowitz</p><h2>End of the Beginning (Pearl Harbor)</h2><p>Six weeks ago, Imperial Japanese military forces conquered and occupied the Hawaiian Islands.

When Justin sets out on a personal odyssey to uncover the mystery of her death, what he finds could make him not only a suspect but also a target for Tessa's killers.</p> <p>A master chronicler of the betrayals of ordinary people caught in political conflict, John le Carr� portrays the dark side of unbridled capitalism as only he can. In <i>The Constant Gardener</i> he tells a compelling, complex story of a man elevated through tragedy as Justin Quayle-amateur gardener, aging widower, and ineffectual bureaucrat-discovers his own natural resources and the extraordinary courage of the woman he barely had time to love.</p></p><p>British diplomat Justin Quayle, complacent raiser of freesias and doting husband of the stunning, much younger Tessa, has tended his own garden in Nairobi too long. Tessa is Justin's opposite, a fiery reformer, "that rarest thing, a lawyer who believes in justice," whose campaigns have earned her a nickname: "the Princess Diana of the African poor." But now Tessa has turned up naked, raped, and dead on a mysterious visit to remote Lake Turkana in Kenya. Her traveling companion (and lover?), the handsome Congolese-Belgian doctor Arnold Bluhm, has vanished. So has Quayle's complacency. <p> Tessa had been compiling data against a multinational drug company that uses helpless Africans as guinea pigs to test a tuberculosis remedy with unfortunately fatal side effects. Her report was destroyed by her husband's superiors; was she? It's all somehow connected to the sinister British firm House of ThreeBees, whose ad boasts that it's "buzzy for the health of Africa!" John le Carr� symbolically associates ThreeBees with an ominous buzz in the Nairobi morgue: "Over [the corpses], in a swaying, muddy mist, hung the flies, snoring on a single note."</p><p> The home office tries to take Quayle in out of the cold. He cleverly eludes their clammy embrace, turns spy, and takes off on a global chase to avenge Tessa and solve her murder. Le Carr� has lost none of his gift for setting vivid scenes in far-flung places expertly described: London, Germany, Saskatchewan, Kenya. His sprinting thriller prose remains in great shape. And thanks to his 16 years in the British Foreign Office, his merciless send-up of its cutthroat intrigues and petty self-delusions is unbelievably good--or rather, believably so. This is global do-gooder satire on a literary par with Doris Lessing's <i>The Summer Before the Dark</i>.</p><p> But you want to know if <i>The Constant Gardener</i> is as good as <i>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</i>. Very nearly. Africa's nightmare is more complex than the cold war chess match, and the world pharmaceutical circus is tougher to dramatize than the old spy-versus-spy-versus-spymaster game. Still, le Carr� can write a smart, melancholy page-turner, and his moral outrage (the real subject of his books) burns as brightly as ever. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b> John le Carr�&nbsp;</b>was born in 1931.

Instead he found a lookalike strip of gas stations, motels and hamburger joints; a continent lost to itself through greed, pollution and television, and lost to him because he had become a foreigner in his own country. A funny and serious view of smalltown America.</p><p>A travelogue by Bill Bryson is as close to a sure thing as funny books get. <i>The Lost Continent</i> is no exception. Following an urge to rediscover his youth (he should know better), the author leaves his native Des Moines, Iowa, in a journey that takes him across 38 states. Lucky for us, he brought a notebook. <p> With a razor wit and a kind heart, Bryson serves up a colorful tale of boredom, kitsch, and beauty when you least expect it. Gentler elements aside, <i>The Lost Continent</i> is an amusing book. Here's Bryson on the women of his native state: "I will say this, however--and it's a strange, strange thing--the teenaged daughters of these fat women are always utterly delectable ... I don't know what it is that happens to them, but it must be awful to marry one of those nubile cuties knowing that there is a time bomb ticking away in her that will at some unknown date make her bloat out into something huge and grotesque, presumably all of a sudden and without much notice, like a self-inflating raft from which the pin has been yanked." </p><p> Yes, Bill, but be honest: what do you really think?</p>" <i>I come from Des Moines. Somebody had to</i>." <br> <br>And, as soon as Bill Bryson was old enough, he left. Des Moines couldn't hold him, but it did lure him back. After ten years in England he returned to the land of his youth, and drove almost 14,000 miles in search of a mythical small town called Amalgam, the kind of smiling village where the movies from his youth were set. Instead he drove through a series of horrific burgs, which he renamed Smellville, Fartville, Coleslaw, Coma, and Doldrum. At best his search led him to Anywhere, USA, a lookalike strip of gas stations, motels and hamburger outlets populated by obese and slow-witted hicks with a partiality for synthetic fibres. He discovered a continent that was doubly lost: lost to itself because he found it blighted by greed, pollution, mobile homes and television; lost to him because he had become a foreigner in his own country.</p><h2>How Sweet the Sound : The Story of John Newton &amp; William Cowper</h2><p>The story of John Newton and William Cowper, authors of some of the greatest hymns in the world, such as &#34;Amazing Grace,&#34; &#34;There Is a Fountain,&#34; and &#34;Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken.&#34; We have heard these tunes played and sung hundreds of times; but few of us realize these are just a small part of a larger collection written by two men who had become close friends.

Krishnamurti was one of the most influential and widely known spiritual teachers of the twentieth century. Here, he inquires with the reader into how remembering and dwelling on past events, both pleasurable and painful, give us a false sense of continuity, causing us to suffer. His instruction is to be attentive and clear in our perceptions and to meet the challenges of life directly in each new moment.</p><p>Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895&#x2013;1986) was one of the most influential spiritual teachers of the twentieth century. He traveled and lectured throughout the world until his death at the age of ninety. His talks and works are preserved in more than seventy books.The work of the influential 20th-century spiritual teacher Krishnamurti (1895&#x2013;1986) is filled with paradoxes: <i>don't follow gurus</i>, this guru advised. <i>Philosophy is an escape</i>, said the man whom the Dalai Lama called one of the age's greatest philosophers. This compilation of lectures sounds again and again Krishnamurti's key themes: learn, and live, by direct experience, not by the received wisdom of texts and teachers. Throw away what was (the past) and what should be (the ideal) in order to perceive through direct observation what is occurring each day and in each experience. Look inside to learn how the mind works and thereby change the world. While Krishnamurti asserts "there is no path to truth," many 20th-century Eastern spiritual teachers followed Krishnamurti's path in popularizing mysticism and meditation in the West. The origin of this book in lectures makes it repetitive at times, although those new to Krishnamurti may find that repetition helpful in clarifying themes. Krishnamurti's influence spread via his talks throughout the world, so the flavor of his oral teaching, in all its provocation, is preserved. Krishnamurti may be too abstract for some; this book will best suit those interested in the intersection of philosophy and Eastern spirituality. <i>(Feb. 14)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"As a man," Strathern writes, "Schopenhauer was a nasty piece of work, but his writings are immensely endearing." While never quite demonstrating how his philosophy "is the first since Socrates to be imbued with the entire personality of the man who propounds it" (though the sampling of excerpts in the back of the book certainly helps), Strathern does convey both Schopenhauer's prickly nature and its contradictions with the ascetic renunciation of the material world that he propounded in his writings. He also demonstrates how that asceticism was influenced by a "questionable use" of Eastern philosophical texts, and how his work would similarly inform that of philosophers like Nietzsche, Freud, and Wittgenstein.Paul Strathern is author of the popular and critically acclaimed Philosophers in 90 Minutes series. Highlights from the series include <i>Nietzsche in 90 Minutes, Aristotle in 90 Minutes</i>, and <i>Plato in 90 Minutes</i>. Mr. Strathern has lectured in philosophy and mathematics and now lives and writes in London. A former Somerset Maugham prize winner, he is also the author of books on history and travel as well as five novels. His articles have appeared in a great many newspapers, including the <i>Observer</i> (London) and the <i>Irish Times</i>.

After Hitler conquered Poland, and while still fine-tuning his plans against France, the British began to exert control of the coastline of neutral Norway, an action that threatened to cut off Germany&#x2019;s iron-ore conduit to Sweden and outflank from the start its hegemony on the Continent. The air, airborne, sea, amphibious, infantry, armor and commando aspects of this brief but violent campaign are here covered in meticulous detail. Henrik Lunde, a native Norwegian and former U.S. Special Operations colonel, has written perhaps the most objective account to date of a campaign in which 20th century military innovation found its first fertile playing field.</p></p><p>Henrik Lunde, US Army (ret.) was born in Norway and came to the United States as a child following World War II. After graduating from the University of California he accepted a US Army commission, and in addition to earning a degree in international relations from the University of Syracuse, he is a graduate of the Army&#x2019;s Airborne, Ranger, and Pathfinder courses as well as the Command and General Staff College and the US Army War College. Much of Colonel Lunde&#x2019;s troop assignments were in airborne divisions or in Special Forces. Highly decorated on the battlefield, he served three combat tours in Vietnam, and afterward in the Plans and Policy Branch of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. His last Army assignment was Director of National and International Security Studies at the US Army War College.

She enjoys reading, walking the Moors, playing tennis, and dreaming of winning Wimbledon.Grade 4-9-A glossy, user-friendly introduction to the playwright and his times. The book is nicely laid out with crisp blocks of text on white background. The succinct entries contain a surprising amount of information ranging from details of Shakespeare's school days to synopses of the plays. Sidebars offer "Did You Know?" facts (e.g., the "curse" actors attribute to Macbeth) and interesting asides. With its compact index, this could be a handy source for students seeking to enliven reports. Full-color photographs of Shakespearean-related sites or scenes from Royal Shakespeare Company productions appear throughout. All are sharply reproduced, but a few of the play scenes are vague and lack enlightening captions. The accompanying audio disc presents some of the most familiar speeches-"To be or not to be-" from Hamlet, "Once more unto the breach-" from Henry V, "All the world's a stage-" from As You Like It, etc.-which can be followed in the text at the end of book. The readings are professional, if rarely inspired, and should be some help to those new to the plays.

Presenting Impressionist works by artists including Manet, Monet, Degas, Bazille, Cassatt, and C�zanne alongside those of Raphael, El Greco, Rubens, Vel�zquez, and others, the book shows that while the Impressionists moved toward modernity and spontaneity, they remained conscious of and interested in the traditions, techniques, and subject matter of their predecessors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Essays by leading scholars reveal the ways Impressionists drew inspiration from earlier artists from periods ranging from the Italian Renaissance through the early 19th-century Classical and Romantic traditions.

Of course it could also be miserable: fog, filthy streets, shabby hovels where too many people live in too few rooms. Schlitz conjures both the magic and the mundane here. . . .Schlitz uses such evocative language that readers will practically smell dirty London and then be relieved by the crisp, cold air in the countryside around the witch&#x2019;s crumbling mansion. The characters are recognizable tropes: the witch is rotting from the inside out; the orphans may be dirty and ill-bred, but they have spirit and pluck; the little rich girl is actually sad and lonely; the skinny puppeteer and the overly dramatic landlady are recognizably Dickensian. Yet, they are so well drawn that they are never caricatures, but people whom readers will cheer for, be terrified of, or grow to like. The plot is rich with supernatural and incredibly suspenseful elements.

From prizefights and polo matches to children playing on the banks of a river, his subjects reflect his vivacious approach to the world around him. A major realist painter, his vigorous brushstrokes also compose landscapes of remote areas of natural beauty, scenes of bustling city streets, and intimate portraits of society figures, friends, and family. All dynamics of early twentieth-century America fill Bellows's canvases and prints.<br>Bellows studied at the New York School of Art under Robert Henri and became one of the leading artists of the Ashcan school. His technical brilliance and vibrant realism were celebrated from early in his career, and at the age of twenty-six he became one of the youngest artists ever to be elected to the National Academy of Design in New York. Bellows exhibited often, to great acclaim, and completed many significant commissions, achieving a powerfully impressive body of work before his sudden death in his early forties.<br>This book brings together the most important works of Bellows's short but prolific career, combining them with an in-depth biography of the artist. Photographs of family and friends, as well as of Bellows himself throughout his life, illuminate the text and complete this portrait of George Bellows, the artist and the man.</p><p>Mary Sayre Haverstock, former Director of the Ohio Artists Project, is an affiliate scholar at Oberlin College, Ohio. She has been an art critic for the Washington Post and contributing editor of Art in America.Action is the key to George Bellows and his vital paintings. Known best for his extraordinarily dynamic and dramatic paintings of boxers in the ring, Bellows himself was athletic, leading art critic Haverstock to wonder if he possessed "an innate kinetic sensibility" that somehow enabled him to capture motion with such thrilling specificity. Haverstock herself adeptly conveys the high energy and bright spirit of her subject, from his questing boyhood in Columbus, Ohio, where his natural-born gift for art was matched by prowess on the baseball field, to his rapid success in New York, beginning in 1905, when he found an ideal mentor in renowned artist and teacher Robert Henri and a treasury of subjects in a&nbsp;city undergoing a dazzling metamorphosis. An unusually upbeat, family-loving artist whose humanitarian values inspired both his candid depictions of the grittier side of life and his landscapes and portraits of brilliant expression, Bellows died too soon in 1925 at age 42. In a handsome volume brimming with rarely reproduced work, Haverstock renews appreciation for this quintessential American painter. Seaman, Donna <br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His client, a woman accused of murdering her daughter because the girl impinged on her carefree lifestyle, is acquitted, but Jack knows there&#x2019;s a lot more to the case than he&#x2019;s been allowed to reveal in court. And after a woman who looks startlingly like his client is beaten nearly to death, Jack discovers that this was no weirdly coincidental act of violence but rather a result of something hidden behind the media spectacle surrounding the trial. After a few lethargic Swyteck novels, the author charged back in 2011 with Afraid of the Dark, and this one is similarly energetic, with a story that&#x2019;s full of twists and turns and, not incidentally, some well-aimed criticisms of the way high-profile trials are covered by the news media. A timely and very well executed story. --David Pitt</p><h2>A State of Mind, My Story Ramtha: The Adventure Begins</h2><p>The &#34;Channel&#34; for Ramtha, a thirty-five-thousand-year-old warrior spirit from Atlantis, recounts her determined rise from her impoverished childhood to become a popular spiritual guide</p><p>Knight has gained notoriety as the medium (or "channel") claiming to be in contact with Ramtha, the spirit of a warrior who supposedly lived in ancient Atlantis. Her pedestrian, self-indulgent autobiography skims the occult, focusing instead on her formative experiencesa brutal uncle who raped her when she was four; a girlhood spent in poverty in New Mexico; her blossoming sexuality during adolescence; her three marriages, the third for love. Yet the paranormal keeps intruding. During a slumber party, she saw a UFO. Fighting a near-fatal illness through meditation, she sent an electrical shock through her body that, she claims, cured her. And then there is Ramtha who keeps materializing in her kitchen in flowing purple robes, mouthing wisdom in stilted diction ("God be that which is termed your birthright").

The lost story of feminine Christianity is here enriched for the first time by the historical context of each woman&#39;s life and her fresh literary expression of spiritual reality. Hildegard of Bingen, Hadewijch of Antwerp, Beatrice of Nazareth, Mechthild of Magdeburg, and Marguerite Porete were acknowledged handmaidens of God&#39;s prophetic spirit. Their teaching, solidly based in theological and metaphysical culture, was even thought superior to that of the scholastic doctors of the time. &#34;Flowing Light of the Godhead,&#34; &#34;The Seven Manners of Love,&#34; and &#34;The Mirror of Simple Annihilated Souls,&#34; written in the vernacular, foreshadowed the works of Meister Eckhart. Ruysbroeck the Admirable, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, and many other mystics. In the, clear, vigorous language of these long-suppressed works, readers of today can rediscover the primacy of love and imagination over pure intellect. Women Mystics in Medieval Europe is an important work of reference for Christians and spiritual seekers as well as an inspirational resource for those who aspire to &#34;see without an intermediary what God is.&#34;</p><p>EMILIE ZUM BRUNN was Director of Research at Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris.Georgette Epiney-Burgard is a specialist in Medieval Dutch literature, language and spirituality.Sheila Hughes taught English language and literature at the British Institute of Rome and Rome University.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Tyler&#39;s Herbs of Choice: The Therapeutic Use of Phytomedicinals</h2><p>2000, trade paperback reprint edition (an earlier version of this title appeared in 1994 under the title: Herbs of Choice), Haworth Herbal Press, NY. 287 pages.</p><p></p><h2>My Early Life: A Roving Commission (Fontana Books)</h2><p>AutoBiography of Winston Churchill.</p><p>The voice of a vanished England speaks from the pages of Winston Churchill's evocative memoir of his first 30 years (1874-1904). The young Churchill inhabits a world in which men fight like hell in meaningless colonial wars--India, Egypt, South Africa--soldiering across the imperial map then extending the hand of friendship to their erstwhile enemy as if they were schoolmates at Harrow. Yet Churchill, born into a privileged family, was not an uncritical supporter of the Victorian status quo. He himself loathed Harrow; an especially amusing chapter skewers the school's emphasis on an irrelevant classical education and rote learning. A firm Tory, he considered himself a friend of the working class, and in 1899 campaigned for parliament with a Socialist colleague. Looking back from his vantage point of 1930, Churchill expresses the most attractive values of the English aristocracy--honor, loyalty, fair play--without giving the impression he wants to live in the past. The book's appeal also stems from its magisterial but colloquial prose. Anyone familiar with recordings of Churchill's rousing speeches during Word War II will hear in their minds' ears that growling timbre and unmistakably patrician accent as they read. Though he would have preferred the peace prize, <i>My Early Life</i> offers good evidence that Churchill's 1953 Nobel for literature was aptly awarded. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Here, in his own words, are the fascinating first thirty years in the life of one of the most provocative and compelling leaders of the twentieth century - Winston Churchill. As a visionary, statesman, and historian, and the most eloquent spokesman against the Nazi Germany, Winston Churchill was one of the greatest figures of the twentieth century. In this autobiography, Churchill recalls his childhood, his schooling, his years as a war correspondent in South Africa during the Boer War, and his first forays into politics as a member of Parliament. My Early Life not only gives readers insights into the shaping of a great leader but, as Churchill himself wrote, &#34;a picture of a vanished age&#34;.</p><h2>How to Paint: A Course in the Art of Oil Painting</h2><p>Covers basic drawing, light and shadow, color theory, composition, design, advanced painting techniques, and practical aspects of painting</p><p></p><h2>I Remember Balanchine</h2><p>Recollections by fellow artists and collaborators elucidate the life of teacher and choreographer George Balanchine</p><p>Since the death of choreographer George Balanchine in 1983, a spate of books illuminating his life and career have been published (e.g., Alexandra Danilova's Choura , Knopf, 1986; Gelsey Kirkland's Dancing on My Grave , LJ 11/1/86; Suzanne Farrell's Holding on to the Air , LJ 9/15/90). The 85 reminiscences collected here by Mason, Balanchine's longtime coauthor ( Balanchine's Complete Stories of the Great Ballets , Doubleday, 1977. o.p.), are anything but redundant. In concert, they provide rare glimpses of this multifaceted creative genius. One of the most significant comments about Balanchine comes from Betty Cage, general administrator of the New York City Ballet from 1947 to 1985: "I don't think there is a definitive portrait of Balanchine. Everybody has a different view, a different perspective." All the views provide entertaining, informative reading, most particularly the recollections of ballet historian Yuri Slonimsky, who presents previously unavailable information on Balanchine's early career in Russia. All dance fans will enjoy this important addition to the growing literature on Balanchine.<br><i>- Joan Stahl, National Museum of American Art, Washington, D.C.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Observing the mourners gathered at George Balanchine's funeral in 1983, Ballet Review editor Mason asked himself how these colleagues might sustain the legacy of America's foremost choreographer, cofounder of the New York City Ballet. Searching for the answer, he interviewed some 100 people. The resulting anthology of oral histories offers a gargantuan array of 85 voices, including both a virtual who's who of 20th-century ballet and sundry other contributors, though Tanaquil LeClercsic , Suzanne Farrell and Jerome Robbins are not represented. At 600 pages, the spectrum of opinion ranges from adulatory to irreverent: Maria Tallchief concludes, "As always, George was right," while William Weslow recalls, in amusing detail, in what respects Balanchine "loved the smell of women." While some of the oral histories share the inherent flaws of the genre--speakers ramble, and individuality of voice is not always vibrantly present--the collection is a sine qua non of Balanchiniana. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The New Spain: A Complete Guide to Contemporary Spanish Wine</h2><p>The New Spain brings the reader up-to-date with this country&#39;s fast-changing wine scene.

After unsuccessfully tempting it with sardines and a plank to a second-story window, Boo tries a rescue but ends up stuck in the tree himself when his ladder breaks. There's more to come, all of which will leave children laughing out loud. With body language and choreography worthy of a classic silent-film comedy, this droll picture book uses page design and the page turns exceptionally well in telling the story. Fully twice the size of the six earlier picture books in the Boo and Ba series, this volume allows for more on a page and has enabled the illustrator to use the space more creatively, which he does by varying the sizes and shapes of his images and using unusual perspectives. Sensitive line drawings create empathy with the well-meaning but calamity-prone characters. Translated from Swedish into economical English prose, the text provides deadpan commentary and short conversations that explain what's happening in the pictures. It's the artwork, however, that makes Boo and Baa stand out as a great comic team.

In 1985 Simon Winchester, struck by a sudden need to discover exactly what was left of the British Empire travelled 100,000 miles back and forth from Antarctica to the Caribbean to visit the far-flung islands that are all that remain of what once made Britain great. His adventures in these distant and forgotten ends of the earth make compelling and often funny reading. With a new introduction and additional material in many of the chapters, this revised edition tells us what has happened while the author&#39;s been away.</p><p>Simon Winchester was born and educated in England, has lived in Africa, Ireland, India and China, and now lives in US. He was a foreign correspondent for 30 years and now contributes to a variety of American and British magazines and newspapers. Hismost recent books have been the two international bestsellers, The Surgeon of Crowthorne and The Map that Changed the World. His new book, Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded is published in June 2002.Simon Winchester travels to the far reaches of the British Empire. Winchester reads his own sometimes oddball tales. He tells of a cricket match on St. Helena in which a fielder falls off the edge and thus is "retired, dead." On Ascension Island, an island so small it was considered a ship--the H.M.S. ASCENSION--any baby born was considered born at sea. Winchester's nicely modulated voice is perfect for reading this history/travelogue. He is engaging while narrating the history and perpetually amused at the quirks of keeping the Empire alive no matter the discomfort. The production concludes with an interview in which Winchester discusses his delight at discovering that readers share his fascination with geology.

He was educated at Royal Grammar School High Wycombe, from which he was expelled shortly after winning a scholarship to Cambridge. He studied moral sciences at Jesus College from 1962, receiving a BA in 1965, incepted as MA in 1967. He was awarded a PhD in 1972 for a thesis on aesthetics, also from Cambridge. After graduating, Scruton spent two years abroad before pursuing an academic career in philosophy, first in Cambridge and then in London. In 1990, he took a year&#39;s leave of absence to work for an educational charity in Czechoslovakia. He then taught part-time at Boston University Massachusetts until the end of 1994, while building up a public affairs consultancy in Eastern Europe. He currently holds three positions: visiting professor at Oxford University; visiting professor in the School of Philosophical, Anthropological and Film Studies at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, and visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington DC.Scruton has created a witty work that operates on several levels: as a gentle satire on the long-lost-manuscript genre, a parody of certain Platonic dialogs, and a tool for teaching some fairly difficult concepts. The preface, which outlines the discovery of the "manuscript," sounds like the plot of one too many novels (as it is intended to), but the "dialogs" have very definite links with ideas present in the "real" dialogs they parody. Those familiar with the Symposium, the Laws, the Parmenides, and the Republic will find Scruton's versions delightful and reasonably faithful to the ideas of the originals. Two of the dialogs presented here are ostensibly written by Socrates' wife Xanthippe?not the shrewish, nagging Xanthippe of the original but rather a bright, articulate, and creative woman. Scruton's characters have a three-dimensional quality that makes his intelligently written satire of the "lost" dialogs work. Recommended for all libraries.?Terry C. Skeats, Bishop's Univ.

When Mary was thirteen, a silver lining appeared in her life: she was invited to spend a summer at Laurel Springs Children&#x2019;s Camp, run by Jane Fonda and her then husband, Tom Hayden. Mary flourished at camp, and over the course of several summers, she began confiding in Fonda about her difficulties at home. During one school year, Mary suffered a nightmare assault crime, which she kept secret until she told a camp counselor and Fonda. After providing care and therapy for Mary, Fonda invited her to come live with her family.<br>&nbsp;<p>Practically overnight, Mary left the streets of Oakland for the star-studded climes of Santa Monica. Jane Fonda was the parent Mary had never had&#x2014;outside the limelight and Hollywood parties, Fonda was a wonderful mom who helped with homework, listened to adolescent fears, celebrated achievements, and offered inspiration and encouragement at every turn.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Mary&#x2019;s life since has been one of adventure and opportunity&#x2014;from hiking the Appalachian Trail solo, working with the Lost Boys of Sudan, and living in the frozen reaches of Antarctica. Her most courageous trip, though, involved returning to Oakland and reconnecting with her biological mother and family, many of whom she hadn&#x2019;t seen since the day she left home. <i>The Lost Daughter</i> is a chronicle of her journey back in time, an exploration of fractured family bonds, and a moving epic of self-discovery.</p></p><p>Mary Williams is a writer based in the Southwest. She is the author of the children&#x2019;s book <i>Brothers in Hope: The Story of the Lost Boys of Sudan</i>. She has also written for <i>McSweeney&#x2019;s</i> and <i>O,</i> the Oprah Magazine.For years I kept my family life a secret from Jane. She knew that I came from a Panther background , but she knew nothing of my mother&#x2019;s drinking, my shrinking family. When I was thirteen that finally changed. The first person I told my full story to was one of my camp counselors. The camp counselor told Jane. Jane asked me if what she heard was true, and for the first time I opened up to her about everything that was going on back in Oakland. &nbsp;Soon after telling her this, Jane invited me to come live with her year-round in Santa Monica. I did not ask my mom&#x2019;s permission. I just left. It was a normal thing in my family to be here one day and gone the next. From my small, run-down house in Oakland, I moved to Jane&#x2019;s hacienda surrounded by flower gardens and avocado trees. Landing on the moon would have been less disorienting. She sat me down soon after I arrived and said, &#x201c;I see you as my daughter now. If you want, you can call me Mom.&#x201d; I also had new siblings, a brother named Troy, and two sisters, Vanessa and Nathalie. Jane became my greatest friend, my cheerleader, and a dedicated mother. Despite being a busy actress and activist, Jane was home most nights and often cooked dinner for us. Everything was new. Even something as seemingly simple as dinnertime was fraught. I had to prepare myself each night for my confrontation with &#x201c;white people food&#x201d;&#x2014;some of it good (baked Alaska), some not so good (artichokes). And I was shocked to learn that people could disagree or dislike one another and still be civil.</p><h2>Devil Takes a Bride (Knight Miscellany)</h2><p><b><i>Celebrated storyteller Gaelen Foley brings her craft to new heights with </i>Devil Takes a Bride<i>, the seductive tale of a man bent on revenge and the beauty who teaches him to love again. . . .<br><br></i></b>In the quiet English countryside, far from the intrigues of London, Lizzie Carlisle slowly mends her broken heart, devoting herself to her new position as lady&#x2019;s companion to the Dowager Viscountess Strathmore&#x2014; until her peaceful life is turned upside down by a visit from &#x201c;Devil&#x201d; Strathmore, the old woman&#x2019;s untamed nephew&#x2014;a dangerously handsome man whose wicked reputation hides a tortured soul.<br><br>Devlin Kimball, Lord Strathmore, has spent years adventuring on the high seas, struggling to make his peace with the tragedy that claimed the lives of his family.

Some said the place was haunted. Others claimed it was cursed. All that His Lordship&#x2019;s unassuming little man-of-business knew, however, was that if his glamorous patron did not soon arrive, he was sure to catch his death in this weather.<br><br>Clutching his umbrella over his head, Charles Beecham, Esquire, stood wrapped in his brown wool greatcoat, his beaver hat pulled low over his receding hairline, and a look of abject misery on his face. He sneezed abruptly into his handkerchief.<br><br>&#x201c;God bless ye.&#x201d; Mr. Dalloway, standing nearby, slid him a greasy grin.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Charles clipped out before turning away from the unkempt property agent with a respectable humph.<br><br>Dalloway was the opposition in this matter, determined to bilk His Lordship out of three thousand pounds for the dubious privilege of owning the godforsaken place. Charles meant to advise his patron against the purchase in the strongest possible terms, not the least because it would fall to him to explain the mad expenditure to old Lady Ironsides. Stealing another discreet glance at his fob watch, he pursed his lips. Late.<br><br>Alas, his staid life as the Strathmore family&#x2019;s solicitor had become alarmingly interesting since His Lordship&#x2019;s return from his high adventures on the seven seas and elsewhere.<br><br>Though barely thirty, the viscount had done the sorts of things Charles preferred to read about from the safety of his favorite armchair. Her Ladyship had oft regaled Charles with tales of her dashing nephew&#x2019;s exploits: battling pirates, chasing down slave ships, living with savages, fending off mountain lions, surveying temples in the wilds of Malaysia, crossing deserts with the nomad caravans of Kandahar. Charles had thought them a lot of cock-and-bull tales until he&#x2019;d met the man. What on earth could he want with this place? he wondered, then rehearsed a diplomatic warning in his head: This, my lord, is precisely the sort of rash adventure that drove your uncle into dun territory. . . .<br><br>Ah, but thinking a thing and saying it to Devil Strathmore were two different matters entirely.<br><br>Just then, a drumming sound approached from behind the wintry shroud of pewter fog and needling rain, like thunder rumbling in the distance. Barely discernible at first, it swiftly formed into the deep, recognizable rhythm of pounding hoofbeats.<br><br>At last. Charles stared in the direction of the plea- sure grounds&#x2019; great iron gates. The ominous cadence grew louder&#x2014;driving, relentless&#x2014;reverberating across the marshes, until it shook the earth. Suddenly, a large black coach hurtled out of the indistinguishable gray, barreling up the graveled drive that offered the only safe course through the boggy waste.<br><br>The quartet of fine, jet-black horses moved like liquid night, their hooves striking sure over the mud and ice, steam puffing from their nostrils. Stationed fore and aft on the shiny body of the coach, His Lordship&#x2019;s driver, groom, and two footmen stared straight ahead, impervious to the weather. They were clad in traditional Strathmore livery, a sedate dun color with smart black piping, stiff felt tricornes on their heads, and frothy, white lace jabots at their throats.<br><br>Charles looked askance at his opponent as Mr. Dalloway ambled down from his shelter atop the flamboyant curved steps of the pavilion. His wily stare was fixed on the approaching vehicle. Noting the gleam of greed in Dalloway&#x2019;s eyes, Charles fretted with the unhappy premonition that his rival would win the day, and then what on earth would he tell Her Ladyship? He could only cork his terror at the thought of the formidable dowager&#x2019;s displeasure by reminding himself of her stern orders seven months ago, upon her nephew&#x2019;s return to London.<br><br>&#x201c;Send all of Devlin&#x2019;s bills to me,&#x201d; the old dragon had instructed in no uncertain terms. When Charles had tactfully questioned the command, seeking only to pro- tect the elderly woman, Her Ladyship had pooh-poohed his hesitancy. &#x201c;It is enough that he has come home at last, Charles. My handsome nephew must cut a dash in Town! You will send his bills to me.&#x201d;<br><br>And so, obediently, Charles had.<br><br>His Lordship&#x2019;s bills, like a flock of ink-smudged doves, had winged their way to the dowager&#x2019;s elegant villa in the Bath countryside: the handsome house on Portman Street and all its elegant furnishings, Aubusson carpets, French damask drapes, Classical paintings and nude marble statues; the wine cellar; the staff&#x2019;s wages; the coach, the drag, the curricle; the horses; the clothes; the boots; the club dues for White&#x2019;s and Brooke&#x2019;s; the opera box, the parties, the jewels for himself and a number of unnamed women; even the IOU&#x2019;s from a few unlucky hands at the gaming tables. Dear old Aunt Augusta had paid them all without a peep. But three thousand quid for an old, abandoned pleasure-ground? It seemed excessive even for him.<br><br>As his coachman pulled the team to a halt in front of the pavilion, Charles swallowed hard, his heart beating faster. The footmen jumped down from their post in back of the coach and marched forward like soulless clockwork automata, one opening the carriage door, the other producing an umbrella, which he held at the ready. Dalloway cast Charles a nervous glance, no longer looking quite so cocky.<br><br>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t met His Lordship yet, have you?&#x201d; Charles murmured under his breath, feeling a trifle smug.<br><br>Dalloway did not answer. He looked again at the coach, where the footman knocked down the folding metal steps and then held the door, staring forward in stone-faced efficiency.<br><br>The first person to climb out of the coach was the amiable Bennett Freeman, a neatly dressed, young black man from America who served as His Lordship&#x2019;s gentleman&#x2019;s gentleman, had followed him on his journeys around the globe, and attended the viscount in much of his day-to-day business. Behind his wire-rimmed spectacles, Mr. Freeman&#x2019;s intelligent brown eyes scanned the bizarre location with a perplexed glance, but when he saw Charles, he waved affably and dashed toward the pavilion to escape the weather.<br><br>Next, a dainty, gloved hand emerged from the carriage, accepting the footman&#x2019;s assistance. Charles sneezed again as His Lordship&#x2019;s latest elegant ladybird stepped down from the coach and minced toward the stairs, teetering over the mud on her high metal pattens. It was not her clothes but her mercenary eyes and wiggly walk that gave away her profession&#x2014;these days the top courtesans dressed as fine as the ton&#x2019;s best hostesses. She wore a tight spencer of maroon velvet and held up her skirts with one gloved hand, while with the other, she tried to shield her magnificent hat with its clutch of ostrich plumes from the steady drizzle.<br><br>Gentleman enough to show chivalry even to her sort, Charles hurried over and gave the high-priced harlot his umbrella.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, thank you, sir,&#x201d; she responded in a breathy purr.<br><br>Dalloway eagerly assisted the hussy in going up the wet stairs.<br><br>Last of all came Devil Strathmore.<br><br>The footman with the umbrella had to hold his arm higher in order to shelter his towering master from the weather. His Lordship slid out of the coach with a sinuous motion, then paused to adjust the fur-trimmed greatcoat of luxurious black wool that hung carelessly from his massive shoulders and draped his powerful frame. Small, tinted spectacles shaded his eyes from the flat, gray glare of afternoon; he wore his long, raven hair tied back in a silky queue. A small gold hoop adorned his left earlobe. Eccentricity, after all, ran in his family, as did his Irish good looks. His skin was still coppered from that desert he had crossed months ago, but his lazy grin when he caught sight of his loyal family retainer flashed like the white cliffs of Dover.<br><br>There was no helping it. Even to a middle-aged fuddy-duddy like Charles, that smile, when Devil Strathmore doled it out, could make a person stand up taller. He looked every inch the hardened, worldly rou�&#x2014;and he was no man to cross, to be sure&#x2014;but if he liked you, there was a warmth in him that no one could resist.<br><br>&#x201c;Charles, good to see you.&#x201d; Lord Strathmore strutted toward him with long-legged, confident strides, the umbrella-holding footman hurrying to keep up.<br><br>&#x201c;My lord.&#x201d; Charles winced at his hearty handshake and nearly tripped forward when the big man clapped him on the back.<br><br>He swept an elegant gesture toward the building. &#x201c;Shall we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, of course, my lord. B-but, first I really must say&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Problem, Charles?&#x201d; He took off his tinted spectacles and stared down at him for a moment with pale, wolf- like eyes.<br><br>Charles looked into that fathomless gaze and saw traces of the wilderness still lingering there: leafy shadows; blue vistas; deep, dark canyons. He gulped. &#x201c;N-no, of course, my lord, no problem. It&#x2019;s just, well, it&#x2019;s a terrible expense, don&#x2019;t you see.&#x201d; He faltered, seeing he was having no effect. &#x201c;That is to say, I am not entirely sure Her Ladyship would approve.&#x201d;<br><br>Dev paused, studying him.<br><br>As an ardent student of human nature, he appreciated the courage, indeed, the loyalty it took his little solicitor to stand up to him. He truly did. All the same, in this matter, he would brook no denial. Explaining his true motives was out of the question, of course. It seemed he was just going to have to brazen it out and insist on having his way because&#x2014;well, because he was Devil Strathmore and had always done exactly what he liked.<br><br>He slipped Charles one of his most charming smiles and tucked his spectacles inside his breast pocket. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be daft, Charles. Aunt Augusta thinks I hung the moon.&#x201d; He turned and jogged up the stairs.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that is true&#x2014;&#x201d; Charles hastened to follow. &#x201c;But perhaps I could explain it better to her if it would please Your Lordship to inform me wh-why you wish to buy this place?&#x201d;<br><br>Dev laughed. &#x201c;Why, for the same reason I do everything: because it amuses me. Come, come, Charles, don&#x2019;t be a killjoy. Let&#x2019;s have a look.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But, sir&#x2014;she&#x2019;ll have my head for this!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Charles.&#x201d; He stopped, turned, and sighed, then affectionately fixed the little man&#x2019;s lapels. &#x201c;Dear, dear, Charles. Neat, tidy Charles. Very well, I shall tell you what&#x2019;s afoot, but I am taking you into strictest confidence. Understood?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir!&#x201d; His eyes widened at this spectacular show of favor. &#x201c;Of course, my lord. You have my word a-as a gentleman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Capital.&#x201d; Dev grasped his shoulder and pulled him nearer, staring firmly at him. &#x201c;Now, then.&#x201d; He bent his head toward the shorter man and lowered his voice. &#x201c;Have you ever heard, Charles, of the Horse and Chariot Driving Club?&#x201d;<br><br>Charles&#x2019;s eyes widened in scandalized innocence. &#x201c;Sir!&#x201d; he breathed.<br><br>&#x201c;Quite,&#x201d; Dev replied. &#x201c;You know how I enjoy the sport of driving.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Y-yes, sir. The curricle, the racing drag, your silver stallion&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Precisely. Well, there are a few . . . shall we say, requirements for entr�e into the club, you see.&#x201d; He ticked them off on his fingers. &#x201c;First, a prospective member must be of good birth, have no morals and a great deal of money.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Dev laughed without humor. &#x201c;Not yet, of course, but it&#x2019;s the same as if I did.&#x201d;<br><br>Indeed, he was counting on his aunt&#x2019;s fortune as critical to his success. Gambling, for example, was how he had gotten close to his targets in the first place, for such sharpers as the boys of the Horse and Chariot Club could always use another deep player to round out the whist table. Curious&#x2014;the more he lost without complaint, the more the blackguards seemed to enjoy his company. But let them win for now, he thought. Soon, they would lose everything.<br><br>Including their lives.<br><br>&#x201c;The second requirement an aspiring member must fulfill is to show his respect by presenting the brotherhood with a suitable gift. This&#x2014;&#x201d; Dev glanced around at the building, then gave Charles a conspiratorial wink. &#x201c;&#x2014;will knock &#x2019;em off their bloody feet.&#x201d;<br><br>At least it would when he had packed the floor with explosives.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard there&#x2019;s a third requirement,&#x201d; he added breezily, &#x201c;but so far, I&#x2019;ve been unable to find out what it is.&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes, but sir&#x2014;the Horse and Chariot!&#x201d; Charles whispered in dread. &#x201c;Everyone knows&#x2014;well, you have been away from Town all these years&#x2014;perhaps you have not heard&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br><br>To Dev&#x2019;s amusement, his little lawyer glanced from side to side, as though Damage Randall, Blood Staines, or that elegant pervert, Carstairs, might be lurking nearby.<br><br>&#x201c;They are a very bad sort, sir. Very bad. Duels&#x2014; unspeakable things! I am quite sure your aunt would not at all approve. Not at all!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, Charles, you may be right, but as I said, I do love the sport. A true aficionado of the four-in-hand is prepared to overlook such things. Don&#x2019;t you agree? I&#x2019;m so glad you gave me your word not to mention this to old Lady Ironsides. Shall we?&#x201d; Dev cast him a silky smile.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, dear,&#x201d; Charles said under his breath, hurrying after him as Dev continued up the stairs. &#x201c;Very well, but do please take care not to appear too eager in front of this Dalloway creature, my lord. He is a low, sly thing.&#x201d;<br><br>Having traded guns, camels, and spices with the Bedouin caravans in Marrakech, possibly the shrewdest hagglers in the world, he trusted he could manage one ill-groomed Cockney property agent, but Dev hid his amusement and bowed to his solicitor with princely grace. It was the man&#x2019;s loyalty that mattered, after all. &#x201c;Thank you, Charles. I stand duly advised.&#x201d;<br><br>Mollified by his acknowledgment, Charles followed him into the building without further fussing. Introductions were quickly exchanged, and in short order, they embarked with Mr. Dalloway on their tour of the pavilion.<br><br>Leaving the octagonal foyer with its red-painted ceiling, tainted mirrors, and touches of chipped gilt, they went through a pair of large, ornately carved doors that looked like the product of some opium eater&#x2019;s fevered fancy. The whole place had an eerie, almost sinister air of intoxication and decay; the lingering odor of stale beer rose up in a fog from the worm-eaten floorboards and mingled with the general musty smell.<br><br>As they moved away from the foyer, the gray daylight shaded into darkness, for the windows were all boarded over. Dev&#x2019;s two footmen carried candles for their party, as did Mr. Dalloway. They ventured deeper into the gloom, the floors creaking like tortured ghosts. One could almost hear the phantom echoes of forgotten laughter; spiders went scuttling across the walls. Even inside, the place was cold enough to cloud their breath.<br><br>The blonde shrieked and huddled close to Dev when something swooped over their heads. Lifting the candles higher, they soon discovered the colonies of bats and house martins that had gotten in through one of the chimneys.<br><br>In the main corridor, the flickering flames of their candelabra revealed tall columns painted like candy canes, a grimy parquet floor laid out in a dizzying zigzag design. Brightly colored, swirling murals flowed fantastically across the walls. Interior doors led to shadowed galleries and a dozen garish salons. There was even a ballroom with an elevated stand for an orchestra.<br><br>&#x201c;God, it&#x2019;s hideous,&#x201d; Ben declared, turning to him.<br><br>&#x201c;Deliciously so,&#x201d; Dev purred too low for Dalloway to hear. He sent his trusty valet and friend a devilish glance. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect.&#x201d; The twisted lads of the Horse and Chariot would love it. The perfect setting in which to lull their senses so he could move closer to the answers he so desperately craved.<br><br>Ben fro...</p><h2>The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius</h2><p>The insights and knowledge of this famed philosopher and Emperor are just as applicable to situations in today&#39;s world as they were in ancient Rome. When The Wall Street Journal asked Bill Clinton to name one book, other than the Bible, that&#39;s important to him, Clinton chose Aurelius&#39; Meditations, which he rereads every couple of years.</p><p>One measure, perhaps, of a book's worth, is its intergenerational pliancy: do new readers acquire it and interpret it afresh down through the ages? The <i>Meditations</i> of Marcus Aurelius, translated and introduced by Gregory Hays, by that standard, is very worthwhile, indeed. Hays suggests that its most recent incarnation--as a self-help book--is not only valid, but may be close to the author's intent. The book, which Hays calls, fondly, a "haphazard set of notes," is indicative of the role of philosophy among the ancients in that it is "expected to provide a 'design for living.'" And it does, both aphoristically ("Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly.") and rhetorically ("What is it in ourselves that we should prize?"). Whether these, and other entries ("Enough of this wretched, whining monkey life.") sound life-changing or like entries in a teenager's diary is up to the individual reader, as it should be. Hays's introduction, which sketches the life of Marcus Aurelius (emperor of Rome A.D. 161-180) as well as the basic tenets of stoicism, is accessible and jaunty. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i>The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus embodied in his person that deeply cherished, ideal figure of antiquity, the philosopher-king. His Meditations, written in moments snatched from military campaigns and the rigors of politics, reveal a mind of exceptional clarity and originality, and a spirit attuned to both the particulars of human destiny and the vast patterns which underlie it.</p><h2>Visual Language for Designers: Principles for Creating Graphics that People Understand</h2><p><p>Within every picture is a hidden language that conveys a message, whether it is intended or not. This language is based on the ways people perceive and process visual information. By understanding visual language as the interface between a graphic and a viewer, designers and illustrators can learn to inform with accuracy and power.</p> <p>In a time of unprecedented competition for audience attention and with an increasing demand for complex graphics, <i>Visual Language for Designers</i> explains how to achieve quick and effective communications.

Yet it resulted in a prehistoric Golden Age of arts and technology thanks to the Sons of Noah, who, forewarned and prepared for the disaster, escaped in 5 organized fleets. Theirs was the masterful Ur-culture that seeded China, Egypt, India, Mexico, and Peru, explaining the sudden injection of the same advanced knowledge and sophisticated arts into those widely separated lands. <br><br>Examining the diaspora from the sunken continent of Pan, Susan B. Martinez finds traces of the oceanic Pan civilization in arts and technologies from canal-works, masonry, and agriculture to writing, weaving, and pottery, but most importantly in the art of navigation, the hallmark of the survivors of the catastrophe. Using archaeo-linguistic analysis, she reveals the mother tongue of Pan hidden in strikingly similar words for royalty, deities, and important places in vastly different languages, including Quechua, Maori, Sanskrit, Japanese, Chinese, Greek, and Sumerian, as well as English through the prefix &#x201c;pan&#x201d; which denotes &#x201c;all-encompassing.&#x201d; <br><br>The author reveals how the Pan diaspora explains the mound builders on each continent, the presence of &#x201c;white&#x201d; humans in Native American legend, the red-haired mummies found in China, and the Ainu of Japan. She shares recent genetic studies that reveal Polynesian DNA in central Europeans, Mesopotamians, South Americans, and the 9000-year-old Kennewick man and shows how Pan provides the missing link. She reveals why carvings at Gobekli Tepe are similar to Toltec artistry, why stone towers in Japan and Easter Island are identical, and how the Pacific Ring of Fire was activated. <br><br>Moving the Garden of Eden from the Fertile Crescent to the South Seas, Martinez strikes down the pervasive view of Atlantis as the source of ancient knowledge and exposes the original unity of mankind on the ancient Pacific continent of Pan.</p><p>Susan B.

She currently lives in Berkshire.Sandra Meech has written Connecting Design to Stitch as a very serious book on design, a much more scholarly work than most. So often we expect our quilting and fiber arts books to be about techniques, but Sandra has taken a different approach. She feels we should pick our colors, embellishments, and surface techniques wisely, not based upon what the latest trends and materials are, but rather based upon how well they will support our theme.<br><br>Connecting Design to Stitch explores how our theme can be carried through our textile art through the judicious use of design elements and principles. Sandra focuses on the creative process more than the details of technique, and she also includes interesting exercises to help us refine our own patterns and preferences.<br><br>'A dynamic design draws the viewer into your work. The strong use of shape, image, or color captures the viewer&#x2019;s interest initially, and then their eye will be led across the rest of the surface.' <br><br>This can be tough for people who have learned quilting through traditional methods, like creating bed quilts with their regularity in design. In order to break through, it is essential, Sandra feels, to have a design wall and a digital camera. Makes sense to me. <br><br>My favorite parts of this book cover about a gazillion suggestions for sources of inspiration, just in case your well runs dry. There are also excellent sections on abstract textile art, compositional styles, and border design. All in all, if you are looking for help with design, this is a great place to start.<br> (<i>mixed-media-artist.com, 11/17/12</i>)</p><h2>Christy Series #8: Family Secrets</h2><p>Many residents are upset when a Black family moves in, but Christy steps in to help the new neighbors</p><p><p>Catherine Marshall began her writing career as a single mother, after the untimely death of her husband in 1949.

There is only one who actually achieved this goal and his name is Gene Conley. One Of A Kind chronicles Gene&#39;s amazing career where he was able to win world championships in Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. One reason that you might not recognize the name of Gene Conley is that he won the World Series with the 1957 Milwaukee Braves and three NBA Championships with the Boston Celtics in 58/59, 59/60 and 60/61. If Gene had achieved this today he would have multi-million dollar contracts with both teams, multi-million dollar commercial endorsement contracts and perhaps be the biggest name in sports. Gene played in an era with some of the all-time greats in both sports. Here is what some of them had to say about him and this book. &#34;Gene Conley was one of the greatest athletes of our generation. There was no tougher or more competitive player than Gene. He is the only man, to my knowledge, to be a member of a championship baseball team and basketball team in the same year. That is quite an accomplishment.&#34; Arnold &#34;Red Auerbach, Boston Celtics President. Red shares Phil Jackson&#39;s honor as the &#34;winningest&#34; coach in the NBA. &#34;Gene and I were both Rookies when we broke into the Majors with the Milwaukee Braves in 1954. I could tell right away that he was going to be a great big league pitcher. He was a natural athlete. He could pitch, run and had a good bat. I enjoyed him as a friend and teammate for several years. I was playing in the 1955 All Star game in Milwaukee when he got the win and we both played together in the 1959 All Star game in Los Angeles. I was not surprised that he was able also to play several years with the World Championship Boston Celtics. What a great achievement to be able to perform at the highest level on World Championship teams in both baseball and basketball. We are to this day, great friends&#34;. Hank Aaron: Present all time Home Run Leader. Inducted into Baseball&#39;s Hall of Fame, played in 21 All Star Games, 23 years in the Majors, 1 World Championship. &#34;Gene Conley was a great pitcher, a tough basketball player, a winner, and dedicated athlete who had a unique way of looking at life.&#34; Tom Heinsohn: In Basketball&#39;s Hall of Fame, he was on 8 World Championship teams with the Celtics, 9 years with them as a player, 6 time all star, 2 World Championship NBA titles as a coach. &#34;Gene was really something. I don&#39;t know of anyone else quite like him. He has a World Series ring and an NBA Championship ring. To have a great success in two sports is rare. To me, Gene was a Giant figure on the mound. He really scared me. You had to respect him. I did and I still do. A great guy.&#34; Willie Mayes: Inducted into Baseball&#39;s Hall of Fame, played in 20 All Star Games. Was on one World Series Championship team. Twice, MVP of the National League. Played 22 years in Major League Baseball and was known as the greatest all around baseball player of all times. &#34;We knew from watching him win the World Series that Gene was a great pitcher. When he came on board with the Celtics, he quickly proved to be a solid rebounder and superb defender in low post. Playing alongside and as a back-up to Bill Russell, Gene played with tremendous motivation and heart, contributing to three more World Championships. A bona fide double legend in two sports, Gene never lost his smile, his team spirit or his positive attitude. Thanks to Katie Conley for insuring his phenomenal accomplishments won&#39;t be forgotten.&#34; K. C. Jones, Inducted into Basketball&#39;s Hall of Fame, K.C.Jones played 9 seasons with the Celtics, was on eight World Championship teams and coached two World&#39;s Championship teams in the NBA.

Their target&#x2014;a prison full of resistance fighters and British agents; their purpose&#x2014;to free them&#x2014;or kill them. Desperate calls to London from the French Resistance told of 100 men and women due to be shot at dawn, and of a British agent being tortured to reveal the secrets of the Allied invasion plan. Film-star RAF pilot group Captain Pickard led the raid that smashed the prison walls and killed the German guards while the Resistance stormed the prison to release their comrades. For more than sixty years this version of events has been believed and many have gone to their graves in the certain knowledge that they had helped save the inmates from certain death and preserved the secret of the coming invasion, but this was not the truth.</p><p></p><h2>The Flower Arranger&#39;s Garden</h2><p>Tells how to plan and prepare a garden, recommends specific varieties of flowers, and suggests ideas for arrangements</p><p>Verey writes that this is a book for gardeners who also are flower arrangers. She gives advice on how to have plenty of flowers and foliage for cutting and still have lots of plants left in the garden. She begins with a chapter on planning gardens--a so-called front garden, a water garden, a sunny and shady border, and what Verey calls an island bed of cool colors and an island bed of hot colors. Verey suggests 40 seasonal flower arrangements and gives a list of 64 essential plants for the flower arranger's garden. Each listing gives information on the plant's hardiness, size, color, sun and soil requirements, and uses. A final chapter offers tips on gardening and flower arranging techniques such as drying flowers, propagation, pruning, mulching, and fertilizing.

She whirred the black iron coal shovel down through the air at her sister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nimble as a circus performer, nine-year-old Allegra pivoted on the stair just in time to dodge the slice of the shovel. She pressed her own attack up the stairs, lunging with her hooked fire poker.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Did not!&#x201d; shouted Allegra.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Did!&#x201d; cried Ada, knocking the poker aside with her shovel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The two girls tradedblows, one scratching the paneling of the stairway, the other taking a deepchunk out of the white banister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Allegra hopped back down one stair, then up again, thrusting past Ada&#x2019;s head, pulling back to use the poker&#x2019;s nasty hook. Ada raised her shovel over her shoulder to catch the hook with another clang and a puff of soot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Poker and shovel locked together, the older sister flicked her wrist, whipping the poker from Allegra&#x2019;s grip, spinning it right around until it shot like an arrow back down the stairs to embed into the doorframe with a reverberating thud.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ada leveled the shovel into Allegra&#x2019;s face in triumph. Quick as lightning, Allegra dropped to her knees, grabbed her sister&#x2019;s ankles, and gave a sharp yank. Ada&#x2019;s bottom spanked hard against the wooden stair. She started to yowl like a wet cat, the shovel skittering down the stairs and along the tiled hall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The toe of a gleaming black shoe stopped the shovel&#x2019;s slide. Above the black shoe was a black-cuffed trouser of a long black suit, and very far atop the suit was the drawn and displeased face of Ada&#x2019;s very large, tall butler, Mr. Franklin. He said nothing, but his silence and his look of disapproval were enough to stop Ada&#x2019;s wailing immediately. He folded himself to pick up the shovel without bending his legs, which struck Allegra as very flexible and Ada as a long way down, and rose again to pluck the still-trembling poker from the woodwork.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Embarrassed, both girls rose and coughed, smoothing their gowns and brushing the soot from their hands, making more of a mess in the process. Neither sister could entirely remember the reason for the staircase duel in the first place, &#x201c;dids&#x201d; and &#x201c;did nots&#x201d; gone in an instant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The butler stared at the pair for a moment with a raised eyebrow, then slowly turned, returning the implements to the fireplace. The girls remained humbled for as long as theycould manage, which was about two entire seconds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That was brilliant!&#x201d; cried Allegra. &#x201c;You have to show me how to do that!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The disarm? It&#x2019;s in the book. Agrippa, I think. Capo Ferro? Fencing books. They&#x2019;re in the library.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t just show me?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t just read a book?&#x201d; Ada replied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Honestly, Ada, you&#x2019;re mean.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re impossible,&#x201d; declared Ada, marching up the stairs to the library. Allegra followed, although she pretended not to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ada found a book on sixteenth-century fencing and pressed it into her sister&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you take a room?&#x201d; she asked, still pushing on the book, prodding Allegra subtly toward the door.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I took three, really,&#x201d; admitted Allegra, not taking the hint at all. &#x201c;They were just empty.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;They weren&#x2019;t empty--they had things in them.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Things under sheets,&#x201d; Allegra clarified.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Things that weren&#x2019;t yours,&#x201d; Ada replied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;re just rooms. And you have a lot of them.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, there were a lot of rooms in the stately Marylebone house in the heart of London, and most of them were empty, except for things under sheets. Curiously for such a grandhouse, there had been only four people living there: Lady Ada Byron; her silent butler, Mr. Franklin; the cook, whose name Ada really was making an effort to remember; and Miss Cumberland, Ada&#x2019;s maid. Ada&#x2019;s father, the notorious Lord Byron, had died on an adventure in Greece two years earlier, when Ada was nine, and her mother had taken to the family estate in the country. But she had not taken Ada. This had left Ada alone with the three servants. Alone, that is, until Ada&#x2019;s half sister, Allegra, had arrived on Ada&#x2019;s doorstep, taking over three rooms and never seeming to settle in any of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Until very recently, Ada&#x2019;s world had been a comfortable, sense-making place of books and ideas, of drawings and charts, of mathematics and puzzles, of machines and inventions and a hot-air balloon of her own making, tethered to the roof, in which to think. Then a month ago all had changed. Her governess had departed, a tutor had arrived, and a fellow tutee and friend with an appetite for adventure appeared. That was certainly enough change for one eleven-almost-twelve-year-old girl.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And none of that called for an additional sister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ada admitted to herself that Allegra was a most capable nine-year-old. She could read and write andjuggle, she could do perfect handstands and even recite some Latin and Italian due to having been raised by nuns on the continent. But &#x201c;settling&#x201d; seemed completely beyond Allegra&#x2019;s abilities. She would fidget, or tap, or twirl at random, or run all the way upstairs and all the way down again if she forgot something. Allegra was so unsettled that she unsettled herself all the way from Italy to England, seemingly for the sole purpose of unsettling Ada.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re only here until--&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, I know,&#x201d; Allegra interrupted. &#x201c;Christmas, when your mother gets home. I&#x2019;ll bet she&#x2019;ll have kittens when she sees me!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You think she&#x2019;ll bring you a cat?&#x201d; asked Ada, confused.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, cranky-head. It means she&#x2019;ll go mad! I&#x2019;ll remind her of our dad, and she absolutely hates him. And me. Isn&#x2019;t that marvelous? She&#x2019;ll lay an egg!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ada loved words and tried to use them very carefully. She found her sister&#x2019;s jumble of egg-laying kittens unsettling. Here, in the library in front of all these treasured books, mixing up words seemed even worse than usual.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ada really wanted to be alone, but it seemed that three almost-empty bedrooms was not enough space for Allegra to twirl about in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Never mind me--&#x201d; started Allegra.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t, then,&#x201d; interrupted her sister, more nastily than she intended.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be off to the circus soon,&#x201d; continued Allegra. &#x201c;I ran away from the nuns for some excitement. And your detective agency is boring.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what you wrote in your letter,&#x201d; said Ada. &#x201c;You wrote that you were coming here to be a Wollstonecraft detective, even though it&#x2019;s supposed to be a secret.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It is a secret!&#x201d; said Allegra excitedly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I wanted to do it in the first place.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;If it&#x2019;s a secret, how did you know? And how did Mother know?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While Ada had her suspicions, she wasn&#x2019;t sure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She and Mary Godwin had been entirely clandestine when they&#x2019;d placed an advertisement in the Times to announce the formation of a private and secret constabulary for the apprehension of clever criminals. And they had used clandestine names when they pursued their first case. Yet a week ago, Ada had received a letter from her mother, the baroness, ordering her to shut down the Wollstonecraft Detective Agency, and the very next day, Ada had received a letter from her half sister, Allegra, saying that she was coming to join them. How did everyone know?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nuns!&#x201d; answered Allegra. &#x201c;Nuns know everything. They have some sort of secret nun powers.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nuns?&#x201d; Ada was unconvinced. &#x201c;You may have lived in a convent, but Mother--&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Secret nun powers,&#x201d; Allegra repeated. &#x201c;Anyway, I heard them talking about how your mother was going around the bend--&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What bend?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The bend. About you and Mary playing detective.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;We weren&#x2019;t playing. We are detectives. We detected. We put a clever criminal in the newspaper.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was true. Ada and Mary had solved a rather delicate case involving a missing jewel, a distraught heiress, an innocent maid, a phony fishmonger, and three men in red fezzes. The clever criminal was indeed in the newspaper, and he was also in prison.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, Ada&#x2019;s hot-air balloon had been lost in the apprehension of the culprit. Its charred remains (the balloon, not the culprit) were now on the bottom of the river Thames rather than at the top of the Byron house. Ada had been sketching plans for an improved balloon--but it wouldn&#x2019;t be ready soon enough to save her from her unsettling sister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;In any event, you&#x2019;re boring, and you won&#x2019;t let me be a detective, so I&#x2019;m off to the circus. Straightaway after Christmas.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not boring, Allegra. Mary and I are trying&nbsp;to help people. I&#x2019;m the clever one, and Mary does people. Well, she notices things about them. It&#x2019;s not&nbsp;that we won&#x2019;t let you. I just don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;d&nbsp;do.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I can juggle.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How would that help?&#x201d; Ada asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m very bendy. I&#x2019;ve been practicing for the circus.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re a secret constabulary, Allegra. We don&#x2019;t need bendy.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You never know,&#x201d; sulked Allegra.</p></p><h2>Healing of Soul, Healing of Body: Spiritual Leaders Unfold the Strength &amp; Solace in Psalms</h2><p><p><b>A source of solace and a healing resource for those who are facing illness, as well as those who care for them. </b></p><p>For centuries, people have turned to the Book of Psalms for solace, comfort and catharsis, seeking guidance, meaning, hope and reassurance&#x2015;in short, spiritual healing.</p><p>This book is intended to help you&#x2015;struggling with illness or helping someone who is&#x2015;derive spiritual healing from Psalms.

Boren, a mostly forgotten humorist, bureaucrat, and erstwhile philosopher (as well as the brother of former Oklahoma Senator David Boren) is credited with discovering the powerful doctrine of &#34;dynamic inaction.&#34; Boren was already semi-famous inside the Beltway for his profound little volume, When in Doubt, Mumble, A Bureaucrat&#39;s Handbook. He defines Dynamic Inaction with one pithy aphorism: &#34;When in doubt, mumble; when in trouble, delegate; when in charge, ponder.&#34; Nowadays we call it gridlock. And despite all the jeremiads coming from the talking heads and pundits in the commentariat lamenting political dysfunction and the imminent collapse of civilization, Dynamic Inaction might just be our salvation.</p><p></p><h2>Sacred Songs &amp; Solos, Bk 2: 8 Well-Loved Hymns Arranged as Both Traditional Song Accompaniments and Stirring Piano Solos for Intermediate Pianists</h2><p>Each book contains eight well-known hymns arranged as both traditional song accompaniments and piano solos.

It's easy to see why: she gets the voice of the late 20th-century New Yorker to perfection, in all its kvetchy, melancholic glory. At times it's like hearing George Costanza channeling Emily Dickinson:<br> <br> <i>I'm never going to sleep<br> with Martin Amis<br> or anyone famous.</i><br> <br> Garrison also tends to sidestep metaphysics in favor of more accessible subject matter. That means love (mostly unrequited) and work (mostly unbearable, particularly for a working girl in a testosterone-driven office, wearied by the appearance of yet "another alpha male-- / a man's man, a dealmaker"). No wonder Garrison seems so appealing. And no wonder her publisher has capitalized on this appeal by packaging her book in such a sleek, chic jacket. It would be a mistake, however, to write her off as one more neurotic light versifier. Her metaphoric agility can take you by surprise: note the Atlantic breeze coming "up out of the surf / like a dog gone swimming, / slagging sand and spray every which way / and making the news unreadable." So, too, can the note of resignation that undergirds so many of Garrison's vignettes-in-verse, giving even her most featherweight performances an odd, unchic intensity."An intense, intelligent and wonderfully sly book of poems that should appeal as much to the general reader as to the poetry devotee." <br>--The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"With their short lines, sneaky rhymes, and casual leaps of metaphor, Garrison's poems have a Dickinsonian intensity, and the Amherst<br>recluse's air of independent-minded, lightly populated singleness. Many a working girl will recognize herself in the poems' running<br>heroine, and male readers will part with her company reluctantly."--John Updike<br><br>"Wry, sexy, appealing -- with a wonderful lyric candor."--Elle</p><h2>Horse Crazy Lily (Young Women of Faith: Lily Series, Book 11)</h2><p>Lily&#39;s in love!

When she is found murdered in the chapel where she kept her nightly vigils, it is thought that she has fallen victim to the Viking raiders who are ravaging the country and the butterflies found resting on her body are taken to be a sign from God. <br><br>But what if Bernwyn was not all she seemed? Could the saintly deeds attributed to her have been carried out by someone else and the people have set up a shrine to a false virgin? <br><br>Throughout the ages, St Bernwyn comes to be regarded as the patron saint of those suffering from skin diseases, and many are drawn on pilgrimage to her shrines. But from a priory in Wales to the Greek island of Sifnos, it seems that anywhere that St Bernwyn is venerated, bitter rivalry breaks out. So when a famous poet is inspired to tell the story of the saint, perhaps it is little wonder that he finds himself writing a satirical piece on the credulity of man.</p><p>Bernard Knight, a former Home Office pathologist, is the author of the acclaimed Crowner John series.

His narrative charts a fascinating course from Vita's lonely childhood at Knole, through her affectionate but &#x2018;open' marriage to Harold Nicolson (during which both husband and wife energetically pursued homosexual affairs, Vita most famously with Virginia Woolf), and through Vita's literary successes and disappointments, to the famous gardens the couple created at Sissinghurst. The book tells how, from her privileged world of the aristocracy, Sackville-West brought her penchant for costume, play-acting and rebellion to the artistic vanguard of modern Britain. Dennison is the acclaimed author of many books including a biography of Queen Victoria. <br>Here, in the first biography to be written of Vita for thirty years, he reveals the whole story and gets behind &#x2018;the beautiful mask' of Vita's public achievements to reveal an often troubled persona which heroically resisted compromise on every level. Drawing on wideranging sources and the extensive letters that sustained her marriage, this is a compelling story of love, loss and jealousy, of high-life and low points, of binding affection and illicit passion &#x2013; a portrait of an extraordinary, 20th-century life.</p></p><p>MATTHEW DENNISON is the author of the critically acclaimed The Last Princess and Livia, Empress of Rome.

The son of impoverished Italian parents, he started his fashion career by sewing for Christian Dior and in the 1950s began to be recognized as one of the young men who would inherit the mantle of Chanel, Dior and Paquin. But as the wealthy clientele for high fashion dwindled, Cardin used the value of his reputation as a designer to move into new areas - menswear, ready-to-wear, fashion boutiques in department stores and the licensing of his name to other manufacturers. Cardin did not invent the designer label, but he exploited the idea to an formidable extent, putting his name on thousands of products, from frying pans to aeroplanes. This biography describes Cardin&#39;s flair for publicity, his relationships with Jeanne Moreau and with his employers and associates, his management style, his pioneering in countries like the USSR and China and his controversial acquisition of Maxim&#39;s.</p><p></p><h2>The Art of Selling Art</h2><p>The revised and enlarged edition of <b>The Art Of Selling Art</b> teaches you - the Key Strategies of Selling Fine Art - How to Read and Effectively Deal with Client Personality Types - Specific Selling Strategies - and the Language of Fine Art Retailing.

This is not to say, however, that it is by any means quiet on the Row, a place where bathtubs double as lawn furniture and adultery, bribery and larceny are commonplace. From the quirky to the certifiable, it seems that everyone has something to hide -- from their cus- tomers, spouses and even themselves. But when a violent storm strikes, causing fire, a heart attack and grand theft, it stirs up more than just the earth it hits. Suddenly, long-buried truths are flowing faster than the flooding rains, and when the dust and smoke finally clear, everything is righted at last. <br> With a strong, rich and uproariously funny voice, Joe Coomer resurrects the magic of his previous novels, <i>Beachcombing for a Shipwrecked God</i> and <i>The Loop,</i> and turns the utterly ordinary into the stunningly extra-ordinary. With a splendid cast of characters and the cleverest canine in comedy, <i>Apologizing to Dogs</i> is a hilarious, heartwarming and wonderfully human tale, proving that no matter how old you get, there's always something worth holding on to, fighting for and loving with all your might.</p><p>About the last thing you'd expect to find on a street arrayed with a dozen antique shops is something novel. Yet Worth Row, the setting for Joe Coomer's eighth book, <i>Apologizing to Dogs</i>, is fairly brimming with surprise and revelation. Romance, thievery, blackmail, and more all come to light on one bewildering day in Fort Worth's historic antique district. By the time the dust has settled, Coomer's quirky cadre of shop owners find their fragile equanimity forever shattered.<p> Slowly and surely losing patrons to the nearby mall, the Row is presided over by the prim and sentimental clothes dealer Nadine, who is the object of carpenter Carl's desire. His other passion, it turns out, is gutting his house to build the ship that he hopes will ferry Nadine and him to a new life. Meanwhile, Carl's neighbor, the recalcitrant Howard Dog-in-His-Path, conceals a bevy of confidences while loafing in his front-yard tub; the reclusive, paranoid Effie peers through her shutters and transcribes up-to-the-minute neighborhood reports in her journal; and, across the street, Tradio and Arthur are caught between the need to reveal they're lovers and the desire to keep the Row's boat from rocking. Just up the street are Mr. and Mrs. Haygood, and next to them are Mazelle--of Mazelle's Rare and Medium Rare Books--and her husband. These two couples form a love-square that gets dug up, literally, by a curious dog.</p><p> Just about every bit of tangled lineage and concealed secret gets exposed in Coomer's outlandish tale. At its best, <i>Apologizing to Dogs</i> reveals the tension between nostalgia and fulfillment, as well as the overwhelming force of our attachments, material or otherwise. "Why do we save old things," Arthur asks Nadine. "Why do we collect these old precious things?" In its improbable eruptions and rambling dialogue, however, the novel occasionally sacrifices verisimilitude for reheated comedy. The paradox of selling the old in order to sustain the present keeps the novel churning along. Soak up the bittersweet laughs, but, as one character says, tellingly, "Don't try to guess the end. Try not to figure it out." <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p>Joe Coomer&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;<i>Beachcombing for a Shipwrecked God, The Loop, Sailing in a Spoonful of Water</i>&nbsp;and an award-winning book of nonfiction,&nbsp;<i>Dream House.</i>&nbsp;He lives in Texas and Maine.</p><h2>Women and Children First</h2><p>&#39;Women and Children First&#39; explores the turmoil of the sinking of one of the most famous ships of all time and its aftermath through the eyes of several different characters.</p><p>Gill Paul is a full-time writer of both fiction and non-fiction.

But three days after Dido Hoare sells him Charles Dickens&#39;s The Haunted Man, her elegant young customer jumps to his death. Not only that: his cheque has bounced. Being as stubborn as the next antiquarian book dealer, Dido sets out to retrieve either the book or her money. Simple? But the book is missing from his flat, and that draws Dido onto a trail from the empty mansion flat to an abandoned house in London&#39;s East End, from threat to cover-up, from betrayal to more deaths. Her determination leads her step by step to an unexpected and perilous truth.</p><p>Marianne Macdonald was born in Canada, moved to England in her twenties and never left. She is a former university professor, actress and playwright, and still is a children&#39;s author. She is married to antiquarian bookseller Eric Korn and has two sons. She lives in North London with her husband and dogs, and travels extensively.London antiquarian bookseller Dido Hoare's retired professor father, Barnabas, says of her, "Dido is extremely persistent, and rather a loose cannon," which sums up this attractive series nicely. Dido lives above her shop with her boy, Ben, and her cat, Mr. Spock. When a regular customer, Tim Curwen, is declared a suicide, and his latest check bounces, Dido is hired by his solicitors to estimate the worth of his books. But all the ones she's sold him seem to have vanished from his flat, except for the Dickens whose payment bounced. After talking with a reporter friend of Tim's and a police contact of her own, Dido learns more about her customer: Tim was gay, mixed up in the drug trade, and may have a sister. Along with her sleuthing, Dido acquires a new computer, sells some books, grabs the odd takeaway meal, and tries to keep Barnabas off her case. A few loose ends matter little, and the denouement resembles life in its untidiness. <i>GraceAnne DeCandido</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

That righteous prologue aside, this is a volume of bedtime stories and yacht-basin scandal that no gossip aficionado could resist. Its about the wealthy socialites who moved in regular sequence from St. Moritz to Acapulco, from Seville to Sardinia, from Monte Carlo to Capri, with occasional respites in Paris, London, and New York. In the early 1960s, when tabloid tales of the Jet Set were gathering steam, Gargia determined to break into ``a society . . . with a polite, but resolute snobbery that kept it hermetically sealed.'' His recipe: Italian good looks, a reputation for performing well in bed, a patron, persistence, and patience. Members of the Agnelli and Rothschild families were early patrons, leading to sexual liaisons with Greta Garbo, Franoise Sagan, and evenas his funds began to run lowwith the 80-year-old widow of a founder of Shell Oil, ``one of the richest women in the world.'' Gargia abandoned his elderly lover (after accepting apartments in Paris and Monte Carlo from her) for the arms of a younger, prettier baroness, launching an extravagant if ``pointless and superficial'' lifestyle. No name goes undropped in this account, ranging from obscure party girls to former empresses, and including Princess Grace, Aristotle and Jackie Onassis, Jack Nicholson, Gianni Versace, Dodi Fayed and Princess Diana, and Sarah Ferguson's toe-sucking lover, John Bryan. Bryan's friend Allan Starkie, a US Army intelligence office turned high-life biographer (Fergie: Her Secret Life, not reviewed), is co-author of this book. After enduring arrest as a suspect in a casino-fixing investigation, the exonerated Gargia, who publishes a magazine called The Best, wants to turn over a new (gold) leaf, urging the so-called beautiful people to do good instead of doing each other. Best of luck to them from all whose insatiable appetites for picayune scandal and vicarious socializing will be at least momentarily appeased by this book. (photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>"To me," the author of this glitzy, fitfully amusing memoir confesses, "there is nothing quite so sexy as deep cleavage filled with enormous diamonds." That statement epitomizes the values embraced by the gaudy parade of titled Europeans and their hangers-on in whose orbits the author has traveled. Gargia recounts at length his affair with Greta Garbo, the "hermit-about-town" whose legendary reclusiveness and sexual reserve he claims to have overcome. He finds Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis a snob, her pretentious conversation unable to engage him or his then-mistress Francoise Sagan. Although the memoirist makes token apologies for the shallowness of his lifestyle, the book mostly chronicles the appetites of a man who finds shopping sexually stimulating and whose central occupationAhis law degree or publishing of The Best magazine notwithstandingAis collecting wealthy mistresses. He nearly wed the wealthy widow Lady Deterding, an octogenarian 50 years his senior and "one of the richest women in the world"Auntil she bragged of a liaison with Adolf Hitler: "One can accuse me of oversensitivity, but I found it a turnoff to learn that my girlfriend had fucked the F?hrer." While Gargia believes that the "jet set" perpetually attempts to create "a fleeting aesthetic of sublime social beauty," this seems to involve little more than gleeful ostentation, promiscuity and idleness. His attempts to elevate himself, as in the claim that he and coauthor Starkie (Fergie: Her Secret Life) uncovered secret KGB files that characterize the deaths of Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed as an assassination, only italicizes the venality on display in these lurid pages.

The book, unlike so many on modern military affairs, does not present a program or defend a policy, nor is it a brief for any one of the armed services. It is a balanced analysis of the requirements of strength for the 1960's, including especially the military posture necessary to prevent war. A unique feature is the discussion of the problem of the cost of preparedness in relation to the requirements of the national economy, so often neglected by other military thinkers.</p><p>Originally published in 1959.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

He describes the most scientific way to house, feed, and care for either a herd of goats or for a single goat. In addition to practical information on raising goats, Mr. Bronson gives fascinating background material about them and their place in history. The reader discovers, for instance, that traces of some of the early legends and superstitions about goats are still to be found in our language today. From Pan, the half-goat god of the ancient Greeks who had the mischievous habit of startling travelers in lonely places, comes our word ''panic.'' Then we learn that in pagan times communities would confess their sins annually to a goat, which was later allowed to escape to the wilderness, supposedly taking the sins with it; hence our word ''scapegoat.'' In his simple, inimitable style, known to many readers through such books as <i>Cats</i>, <i>Starlings</i>, <i>Coyotes</i>, <i>The Wonder World of Ants</i>, <i>The Grasshopper Book</i>, <i>Horns and Antlers</i>, <i>The Chisel-Tooth Tribe</i>, and <i>Turtles</i>, Mr. Bronson provides a humorous and informative text, enhanced by detailed drawings on nearly every page.</p><p>Wilfrid Swancourt Bronson wrote his first book at the age of eight.

Here, she deals with the brujos and brujas of Mexico and their concept of Dreaming Awake. She paints a bizarre portrait of her initiation into a sorcerous world where people appear and disappear with alarming regularity, and where the lines between consciousness and dream states become blurred. Donner experiences a series of fainting fits, temper tantrums, and dream-like journeys during the initiation process, but her only esoteric insight is that women are slaves who think and feel power through their wombs. (Could this mean that women who have undergone hysterectomies are brainless and spiritually dead?) Recommended only where Castaneda is still read or the works of Lynn V. Andrews are popular.

Gartner, Ph.D.,</b> is a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University Medical School. He is a graduate of Princeton University. He is widely published in scholarly journals and books, and his work has also appeared in the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> and <i>Talk</i> magazine. Gartner lives and practices as a clinical psychologist in Baltimore.<b>Introduction: The Hypomanic American</b><br><br><b>The Hypomanic Entrepreneur</b><br><br>The 1990s will be remembered as the age of Internet mania, a time when entrepreneurs making grandiose claims for their high-tech companies swept up millions of Americans with their irrational exuberance, inflating the biggest speculative bubble in history. The idea that some entrepreneurs may be a little manic is hardly new. A Google search for "manic" and "businessman" yields more than a million hits. Entrepreneurs, as well as the markets they energized, were commonly described in the media as "manic." Yet, until now, there has never been a serious suggestion that the talent for being an entrepreneur and mania, the genetically based psychiatric disorder, are actually linked. Perhaps because I am a clinical psychologist, it was clear to me that "manic" was more than a figure of speech in this case.<br><br>I called several reporters who had written profiles of these "manic" entrepreneurs and asked them, "Do you think he really was manic?" None said yes. "Not <i>really</i> manic; not clinically," was a typical response. They resisted applying the psychiatric diagnosis because the entrepreneurs they had interviewed were boastful, hyperenergized, and zany, but they "weren't crazy." And the journalists were right. Their subjects were not manic. They were <i>hypomanic.</i> Hypomania is a mild form of mania, often found in the relatives of manic depressives. Hypomanics are brimming with infectious energy, irrational confidence, and really big ideas. They think, talk, move, and make decisions quickly. Anyone who slows them down with questions "just doesn't get it." Hypomanics are not crazy, but "normal" is not the first word that comes to mind when describing them. Hypomanics live on the edge, betweeen normal and abnormal.<br><br>For example, Jim Clark, cofounder of Netscape, was described in <i>Business Week</i> by Netscape's other cofounder, Jim Barksdale, as "a maniac who has his mania only partly under control." In <i>The New New Thing,</i> Michael Lewis profiled Clark as a perpetual motion machine with a short attention span, forever hurtling at unsafe speeds in helicopters, planes, boats, and cars. When his forward motion is impeded, Clark becomes irritable and bored. In his search for the stimulation of the "new new thing," he quickly loses interest in the companies he founds and tosses them into the laps of his bewildered employees. His Netscape IPO is credited 0 with starting the Internet gold rush. After that it seemed he could do no wrong. When he pitched a new company, Healtheon, a medical Web site, his only business plan was a diagram with five words. His "magic diamond" put Healtheon at the center of four vertices labeled "doctors, consumers, providers, and payers." That was it. His magic diamond, he claimed, was going to "fix the U.S. health care system." It was going to be "bigger than Microsoft, AOL, Netscape and Yahoo!" As Lewis wrote, "Any other human being would have been thrown into an asylum for thinking such grandiose thoughts." Those who followed Clark had faith in his messianic mission. "There was a feeling that we <i>were</i> about to change the world," said one of Healtheon's chief engineers.<br><br>Successful entrepreneurs are not just braggarts. They are highly creative people who quickly generate a tremendous number of ideas -- some clever, others ridiculous. Their "flight of ideas," jumping from topic to topic in a rapid energized way, is a sign of hypomania. Consider Bill Gross, CEO of Idealab. Bill Gross's job was not to build or run companies, but just to think of ideas for them. Idealab was an "Internet incubator." On <i>Fortune's</i> cover, next to a picture of a cheerful Bill Gross, was the caption "I Lost $800 Million in Eight Months. Why Am I Still Smiling?" The author, Joseph Nocera, <i>Fortune's</i> managing editor, begins his article with an unusual mea culpa. He apologizes to his readers for his previous <i>Fortune</i> article that hyped Gross and Idealab just before the Nasdaq crash. He confesses that Gross converted him into a believer:<br><br>I believed him because I was dazzled by him. A small, wiry man, Gross had an infectious boyish enthusiasm that was charming and irresistible. He spoke so rapidly -- jumping from topic to topic as if he were hyperlinking -- that it was hard to keep up with him, and had so much energy he seemed constantly on the verge of jumping out of his skin. He bubbled over with irrepressible optimism.<br><br>And his brain! That's what really set him apart. You could practically see the ideas bursting out of it, one after another, each more offbeat, more original, more promising than the last. The sheer profusion of ideas -- and the way he got excited as he described them -- was a large part of his charisma.<br><br>The reason Bill Gross was still smiling was that his newest new idea was "going to be unbelievably huge" and "revolutionize the Internet." Eight hundred million. Eight hundred shmillion. Nothing could dim Gross's enthusiastic confidence.<br><br>During the 1990s, I was paying attention to such behavior because I was planning to write a book about religious movements started by manic prophets. But I began to be distracted by messianic movements happening around me in real time, particularly because, as an avid technology investor, I was a member of one -- the believers in the new economy. I was even a millionaire on paper for one exhilarating day in March 2000 at the peak of the market, before my portfolio lost 90 percent of its value. I began to suspect I was writing the wrong book.<br><br>My new hypothesis became that American entrepreneurs are largely hypomanic. I decided to undertake what social scientists call a pilot study: a small-scale, inexpensive, informal investigation meant to test the waters. I placed announcements on several Web sites devoted to the technology business, expressing my interest in studying entrepreneurs and requesting volunteers. I interviewed a small sample of ten Internet CEOs. After I read them each a list of hypomanic traits that I had synthesized from the psychiatric literature, I asked them if they agreed that these traits are typical of an entrepreneur:<br><br><ul><br> <li>He is filled with energy.<br><br> </li><li>He is flooded with ideas.<br><br> </li><li>He is driven, restless, and unable to keep still.<br><br> </li><li>He channels his energy into the achievement of wildly grand ambitions.<br><br> </li><li>He often works on little sleep.<br><br> </li><li>He feels brilliant, special, chosen, perhaps even destined to change the world.<br><br> </li><li>He can be euphoric.<br><br> </li><li>He becomes easily irritated by minor obstacles.<br><br> </li><li>He is a risk taker.<br><br> </li><li>He overspends in both his business and personal life.<br><br> </li><li>He acts out sexually.<br><br> </li><li>He sometimes acts impulsively, with poor judgment, in ways that can have painful consequences.<br><br> </li><li>He is fast-talking.<br><br> </li><li>He is witty and gregarious.<br><br> </li><li>His confidence can make him charismatic and persuasive.<br><br> </li><li>He is also prone to making enemies and feels he is persecuted by those who do not accept his vision and mission.<br></li></ul><br><br>I feared they might find the questions insulting. I needn't have worried. <i>All</i> of the entrepreneurs agreed that the overall description was accurate, and they endorsed all the hypomanic traits, with the exceptions of "paranoia" and "sexual acting out" (these traits in particular are viewed as very negative and thus may be more difficult to admit to). Most expressed their agreement with excitement: "Wow, that's right on target!" When I asked them to rate their level of agreement for each trait on a standard 5-point scale, many gave ratings that were literally off the chart: 5+s, 6s. One subject repeatedly begged me to let him give a 7. I was startled by the respondents' enthusiasm, though perhaps I shouldn't have been. As a psychotherapist, I am familiar with the way people become energized when they feel understood, especially when it helps them understand themselves better.<br><br>Having learned in our conversation that they were hypomanic, the CEOs wanted to talk about it. One now understood better why he regularly rented palatial office space he could not afford and why his wife hid the checkbook. Another could finally explain what drove him to impulsively send broadcast e-mails at 3 A.M. to all his employees, radically revising the company's mission. It was as if merely by asking these questions I had held up a mirror in which these men could see themselves. After talking to them for just fifteen minutes, it seemed as if I was the first person to truly understand them.<br><br>One respondent seemed to be in an intense hypomanic state when I interviewed him. He responded to my Web site solicitation by e-mailing me in huge blue block letters: "CALL ME IMMEDIATELY." When I did, he talked rapidly and loudly and laughed quite often. At the same time he was charming, witty, and engaging. The interview was a bit chaotic because he was driving and carrying on another phone call at the same time. He was a serial entrepreneur. After founding one successful company, he had felt he needed to quit his own corporation because he couldn't "make things happen fast enough," leaving him frustrated and bored. Now he was on to a new venture. He was very enthusiastic about my research and volunteered to send me the phone numbers and e-mail addresses of half a dozen well-known high-tech entrepreneurs (which I never received), who he claimed were his "very close friends."<br><br>This was a small pilot study, but nonetheless, I was overwhelmed. I had never seen data like this. Because humans are <br><br>so complex, most effects in psychology are modest and nearly drowned out by the great variability that exists naturally between people. Not in this case. One hundred percent of the entrepreneurs I interviewed were hypomanic! This couldn't be chance. The odds of flipping a coin ten times and getting ten heads in a row is less than one in a thousand. It felt as if I had tested the waters with my little pilot study and been hit with a tidal wave. It was then that I knew I had stumbled onto something big that had been hiding in plain sight.<br>rd<br><br><b>Mania and Hypomania</b><br><br>A colleague of mine once told me about a manic inpatient he had treated for many years at an Ivy League-affiliated psychiatric teaching hospital. The patient's father was the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. Each time he visited his son on the unit, he would behave in a dramatically hypomanic fashion. For example, he would make numerous business phone calls around the world on the patients' pay phone, while frantically yelling "Back off!" at patients or staff who tried to interrupt him. Clearly, Dad was not normal, but he had made his hypomania work for him. He was a very rich man.<br><br>This family's story illustrates the concrete relationship between mania and hypomania. Manics and hypomanics are often blood relatives. Both conditions run together in families at much higher rates than we would predict by chance.6 We know that their genes overlap, though we don't know how.<br><br>This family's story also illustrates the most radical difference between mania and hypomania. Mania is a severe illness. The son was disabled -- a long-term inpatient at a psychiatric hospital. Manic episodes almost always end in hospitalization. People who are highly energized, and also in most cases psychotic, do bizarre things that are dangerous, frightening, and disruptive. They urgently require external control for everyone's safety, especially their own. Most people who have experienced a manic episode remember it as a nightmare.<br><br>By contrast, hypomania is not, in and of itself, an illness. It is a temperament characterized by an elevated mood state that feels "highly intoxicating, powerful, productive and desirable" to the hypomanic, according to Frederick K. Goodwin and Kay Redfield Jamison, authors of the definitive nine-hundred-page <i>Manic-Depressive Illness.</i> Most hypomanics describe it as their happiest and healthiest state; they feel creative, energetic, and alive. A hypomanic only has a <i>bipolar disorder</i> if hypomania alternates, at some point in life, with <i>major depression.</i> This pattern, first identified only in 1976, is called bipolar disorder type II to distinguish it from bipolar disorder type I, the classic manic-depressive illness, which has been well known since the time of the ancient Greeks. If a hypomanic seeks outpatient treatment it is usually for depression, and he will define recovery as a return to his old energetic self. Not all hypomanics cycle down into depression. What goes up can stay up. Thus, we cannot conclude that someone has a psychiatric disorder just because he may be hypomanic. The most we can say is that hypomanics are at much greater risk for depression than the average population. The things most likely to make them depressed are failure, loss, or anything that prevents them from continuing at their preferred breakneck pace.<br><br>0Given how radically different mania and hypomania are, it is perhaps surprising that the diagnostic criteria for these two conditions are identical according to the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> of the American Psychiatric Association (usually referred to simply as <i>DSM-IV):</i><br><br><ul><br> <li>A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, lasting at least one week.<br><br> </li><li>B. And at least three of the following:<br><br> </li><li>1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity<br><br> </li><li>2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only three hours of sleep)<br><br> </li><li>3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking<br><br> </li><li>4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing<br><br> </li><li>5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli)<br><br> </li><li>6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation<br><br> </li><li>7. Excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments)</li></ul><br><br>The only guideline offered to mental health professionals in distinguishing between mania and hypomania is "degree of severity." Hypomania is "not sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to require hospitalization." But <i>DSM-IV</i> tells us little else, when there is so much more that could be said.<br><br>This relative neglect of hypomania by psychiatry is striking when we consider that it affects many more people than does mania. We know from numerous large-scale studies, replicated both nationally and internationally, that classic manic depression exists in slightly less than 1 percent of the general population. A notably smaller but growing amount of literature on hypomania suggests that 5 to 10 percent of the population is hypomanic. Whatever the exact percentage, psychiatry's most recent discovery is not a rare expression of bipolar genes, but its most common form.</p><h2>Across the High Frontier: The Story of a Test Pilot-Major Charles E.

Grade 5-9&#x2013;In this practical guide, Larson shares his obvious passion for his work, discussing scientific methods and a wide variety of fossil-hunting techniques. The conversational style of the writing, filled with plenty of challenging questions and easy-to-follow analogies, effectively brings readers into this fascinating world. While most will probably never get the opportunity to prepare fossils in a lab, the basic instructions convey what it would be like if the chance should arise. The value of finding a mentor&#x2013;someone with more experience who can make fossil finding more interesting (and safe) for young beginners&#x2013;is stressed. Though Larson asserts that anyone can hunt fossils in one way or another, he also makes it clear that it can be hard and time-consuming work: "It takes about 25,000 hours of skilled preparation to clean a whole <i>T. rex</i>." Many of the examples used come from the author's own finds, and notable discoveries made by kids and teens are also highlighted. A teacher's guide is appended. Illustrations include high-quality color photographs and helpful diagrams and drawings. There's fascinating information here, and Larson's enthusiasm and sound advice give plenty of encouragement to young scientists.<i>&#x2013;Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, OR</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dick and the British Fantasy Society awards. He has published more than fifteen books, many set within his Polity&#x201d; universe, including <i>Gridlinked</i>, <i>The Skinner</i>, and <i>Dark Intelligence</i>. He divides his time between Essex and a home in Crete.<br>Here Asher retreats to the formative years of his series hero Ian Cormac to reveal formative&nbsp; events in two time lines to reader and character alike. Growing up in the last years of the Prador war,&nbsp; Ian deals with the loss of his father, the too-terrible-to-remember horrors his army-medic brother has seen, and a war drone that looks like a scorpion and appears in some strange places. Reaching young manhood, he signs up with the Earth Central Security force and heads out to a world devastated by the Prador. While guarding a Prador crash site, he is accidentally caught up in uncovering a separatist movement, an involvement that costs him comrades and whatever innocence he may have had left. Discovering his capacity for violence, he chases down the most dangerous of the separatists and learns the significance of that scorpion war drone he vaguely recalls from childhood. This slim volume that greatly develops Cormac&#x2019;s character is an excellent window into the world&#x2014;the Polity universe&#x2014;that Asher has created in the Ian Cormac and Prador novels. --Regina Schroeder</p><h2>The Building of the Green Valley: A Reconstruction of an Early 17th-Century Rural Landscape</h2><p>This book presents the story of the construction of the 17th century historical landscape used in the BBC2 television series &#39;Tales from the Green Valley&#39;. On one level it is the tale of a bizarre social project carried out by some 400 muscular historians, re-enactors, international volunteers, cavers and mountain climbers. On another it provides a detailed account of the development of a valuable experimental history project with wide educational and research applications, on a minimal budget. It catalogues a unique restoration of a derelict historic farming landscape, from buildings and field boundaries to woodlands and weed patterns, and describes its current management, on a social farming basis, with livestock co-operatives and adopted orchards.</p><p>Stuart Peachey graduated from Reading in 1977 with a BA Hons, in Human Geography doing his postgraduate teaching qualification at St Paul&#39;s College Cheltenham 1978-79. His other qualifications vary from mountain leadership to food hygiene. Interested in military history from an early age, after arriving at Reading he was recruited to a new English Civil War Unit based at the University. When asked in 1983 to run a living history in Gosport he found there was no suitable venue and suggested that they built one from scratch. Recruiting a team of 35 volunteers who worked 15 hours a day for up to 15 days they constructed a hamlet which the council decided to retain. The funds accidentally raised by this project were used to buy the Green Valley site where over nearly 20 years over 500 volunteers from 28 countries have toiled to restore and maintain an early 17th century agricultural landscape. Stuart carried out the majority of the supporting historical research and the organization of the site development in parallel with careers in lecturing, commercial banking and the Yorkshire Dales National Park. He has written or co written over 110 small specialist publications on period food, agriculture, living history topics and the English Civil War and contributed to a substantial number of radio and TV programmes and magazines on historical matters. In 1987 he co founded Historical Management Associates Ltd which has developed a publishing arm, runs period feasts and carries out consultancy work among other activities. In his spare time he is an active mountain walker and caver and father of three boys.</p><h2>Noisy Nora</h2><p>Noisy Nora With All New Illustrations</p><p>Rosemary Wells&#39; tales of animals with very human problems make her a favorite from the board-book years on.

He is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of nine novels, including <i>The Ten Thousand, They Are Soldiers, God's Children,</i> and <i>More than Courage.</i> He lives in Fairfax, VA.Chapter One <p></p>Alexandria, Virginia - September 3 <p></p> <p></p>The feeling of the sheets being pulled away from her, quickly followed by a sudden intake of breath from the other side of the bed, woke Christina Dixon with a start. Lifting her head from her pillow, she peered across at her husband, checking to see if he was awake yet. In the faint light that filtered in through the partially closed blinds, she watched as Nathan clutched the sheet to his chest in a death grip. His lips quivered as if he were speaking. It wouldn&#x2019;t be long before he was awake, Christina sadly concluded. It never was on a night like this. Taking great care, she laid her head back down on her pillow before rolling over on her side, facing away from Nathan. Through trial and error she&#x2019;d learned the hard way that the best thing she could do was to pretend that her husband&#x2019;s nocturnal stirrings didn&#x2019;t wake her. For some reason, knowing that his nightmares were depriving his wife of badly needed rest only added to Nathan&#x2019;s worries. He had enough on his mind, Christina reasoned. She didn&#x2019;t need to add to them. <p></p> <p></p>With a suddenness that startled him, Nathan Dixon was catapulted from the dark, haunting place where his subconscious had taken him back into the dimly lit bedroom he shared with his pregnant wife. For the briefest of moments, he lay there staring wide eyed at the ceiling, gasping for breath like a drowning man as he struggled to compose himself. How strange, he found himself thinking after he&#x2019;d managed to regain some semblance of mental balance, to find the memories of a battle long since past more terrifying than the event itself. Try as he might, he couldn&#x2019;t remember experiencing anything even remotely resembling fear that night in the jungle. There&#x2019;d simply been too much to do, too much going on around him. Had there been confusion? Yes, of course. There always was in battle, particularly that one. Cutting through it and maintaining his focus on tactical concerns were the only things he recalled running through his mind as his company came to grips with Abu Sayyaf insurgents. The fear, like the haunting memories from which it sprang, only came later, long after he&#x2019;d been medevaced out of the Philippines. And rather than fading with the passage of time, his recollection of what happened that night only seemed to grow stronger, more intense, causing Nathan to wonder if his mind was hellbent on sorting out the blurred images that he hadn&#x2019;t had the time to pay attention to that night. <p></p> <p></p>Having regained a modicum of self- control, Nathan looked over to see if his stirrings had woken his wife. Only when he was satisfied that she was still sound asleep did he carefully lift the covers off of himself, slip out of bed and quietly make his way to the guest bathroom just down the hall. Waiting until after he&#x2019;d closed the door, Nathan flipped on the light, turning to face the mirror as he did so. The first thought that popped into his head as he stared at his gaunt reflection was always the same on nights like this: was he going mad? Of course not, he quickly told himself&#x2014; perhaps too quickly. It&#x2019;s just the way things were, he reasoned. It was a new normal he hadn&#x2019;t quite yet managed to adjust to. Like the collection of wounds he&#x2019;d amassed along the way, the memories of past events were a natural and not at all surprising psychological byproduct stemming from his chosen profession. That his late father had never seemed troubled by his past didn&#x2019;t matter to Nathan. Scott Dixon had always come across as being one of those people who were bigger than life, a man who always gave the impression of being in complete control no matter how dire the situation. At least, that&#x2019;s the way Nathan and those who knew him chose to remember Scott. And despite his knack for coming across as a nonconformist in a profession where conformity was prized above all else, more than a few well- placed individuals who were privy to such things had pegged Scott Dixon as a shoe-in for the Chief of Staff of the Army. <p></p> <p></p>Without realizing it, Nathan&#x2019;s concern over the recurring nightmares that plagued him was replaced by a deep, almost painful longing for his father. If there was anyone who would understand what he was going through, who could help him come to terms with his inability to put things in proper perspective, it was his father. Whether it stemmed from Scott Dixon&#x2019;s experience as a long- serving officer or was simply an inherent talent, he had a way of sweeping away all the peripheral fluff and chaff with ease, striking at the heart of the matter at hand with a deftness that inspired envy and confidence. <p></p> <p></p>Planting his hands firmly upon the countertop, Nathan leaned forward, peering at his own reflection. If his father&#x2019;s incisiveness was an inherent trait, he thought to himself, it seemed to have skipped a generation. Even now, after devoting an inordinate amount of time pondering his future, Nathan had no idea what he would say when the question he knew was coming was put to him later that day. Glancing in the mirror at the clock on the wall behind him, he realized that he didn&#x2019;t have much time left to formulate a suitable answer, one that would address all the issues and concerns he found himself burdened with. <p></p> <p></p>Sadly, the younger Dixon concluded that there was little point in returning to bed where he&#x2019;d do nothing more than toss and turn until he woke Chris. On mornings like this, it was better to head out into the predawn darkness and run. While doing so wouldn&#x2019;t help him reach any sort of decision, pushing his body to the limit would at least give his troubled mind a much- needed break. Besides, Nathan reasoned as he turned to gather his running shorts and T-shirt hanging on the back door of the bathroom, if he did decide to stay in the Army, he needed to get back in shape. Giving into the pain that lingered from his wounds was no longer an option, not if he was going to be the kind of soldier he&#x2019;d been raised to be. <p></p> <p></p>The opening of the front door, followed by the sound of someone removing their shoes before venturing any farther, caused Jan Fields to stop what she&#x2019;d been doing. For the briefest of moments an irrational thought flashed through her mind, one that was as foolish as her efforts to convince herself that the visit by the former Chief of Staff of the Army with the obligatory chaplain in tow had never happened. These absurd little flights of fancy weren&#x2019;t helped any by the fact that her stepson&#x2019;s habits, even the noises he made as he climbed the stairs leading up to the main floor of her town house, were all but indistinguishable from those his father used to make whenever he returned from an early morning run. At times like this, Jan almost found herself having to stop what ever she was doing and mutter out loud, "It&#x2019;s not Scott. It is not Scott." <p></p> <p></p>She barely had time to regain her composure before Nathan came plodding into the kitchen where she&#x2019;d been in the pro cess of slicing up a wedge of cantaloupe. Stealing a quick, fugitive glance over her shoulder, Jan took note of Nathan&#x2019;s limp before turning her attention back to what she was doing. "You&#x2019;re up early," she stated crisply, doing her best to sound cheery despite the pain she felt over her son&#x2019;s suffering. <p></p> <p></p>Before answering, Nathan reached around her, quickly snatching a chunk of cantaloupe from the cutting board. He wasn&#x2019;t fast enough, however, to escape a quick slap on the back of his hand from Jan, who used the flat of her knife to punish his impatience. "Wait till I&#x2019;m done." <p></p> <p></p>"Why?" he countered before popping his pilfered prize in his mouth. <p></p> <p></p>"Because you haven&#x2019;t washed your hands, that&#x2019;s why." She was about to add "young man" to her response as she&#x2019;d done so many times over the years, but didn&#x2019;t. Somehow it just didn&#x2019;t seem appropriate to refer to a captain in the Army, whose name had just come out on the latest promotion list, in that manner. <p></p> <p></p>For his part Nathan found it all but impossible to suppress a chuckle as he made his way over to the sink. "And what&#x2019;s so funny?" Jan asked incredulously. <p></p> <p></p>Knowing better than telling her what was really on his mind, he opted for a response that was in keeping with his determination to keep things as lighthearted and easygoing as possible while he and Chris were living with Jan. "Geez, Mom," he mockingly whimpered. #34;You&#x2019;re acting like I was a five- year- old." <p></p> <p></p>"Well, when you act like you&#x2019;re five . . ." <p></p> <p></p>Her words were cut short by the sight of a hand reaching around from behind her in an effort to snatch another chunk of cantaloupe. This time she managed to slap her son&#x2019;s hand with the flat of her knife before he managed to secure a piece of fruit from her cutting board. <p></p> <p></p>"Ouch! That hurts." <p></p> <p></p>"Good," Jan replied in triumph. "Now, be a good boy and sit down and give me a chance to finish." <p></p> <p></p>"Gee," Nathan muttered, shuffling over to the breakfast bar where he took a seat, making a great show of rubbing the back of his hand as he did so. "Where&#x2019;s the respect?" <p></p> <p></p>Rather than respond, Jan smiled to herself as she turned her attention back to finishing with the cantaloupe. It was moments like this that vindicated her decision to insist that Nathan and his wife stay with her while awaiting new orders after he&#x2019;d been discharged from the hospital. Whatever inconvenience and disruption they caused in her life were more than offset by the opportunity they afforded her to once more be part of a family. And though she knew that Nathan and Chris would soon be moving on, just as she and Scott had done with a regularity that was often annoying but always exciting, Jan was determined to make the most of this fleeting opportunity. There&#x2019;d be plenty of time later, she reasoned, to resume her silent mourning for the only person she&#x2019;d ever loved. The thought of an eternity of coming home to an empty house, dinner alone and long lonely nights caused Jan to shiver. It was a response she&#x2019;d learned to keep to herself, lest she burden Nathan, who had more than enough to worry about, from noticing. <p></p> <p></p>Over a light breakfast of fruit, English muffins, orange juice and coffee, Jan and Nathan chatted over the upcoming day&#x2019;s activities. Nathan listened as Jan discussed in detail her schedule. As the Washington bureau chief for the World News Network, her day was pretty much nonstop, from the moment she stepped into her downtown office till she arrived back home in the early evening. Even then, she seldom slowed down, especially since world events refused to maintain the sort of tight, well- ordered schedule that Jan endeavored to live by. <p></p> <p></p>For his part Nathan silently envied the hectic day that awaited his mother. Whatever joy he&#x2019;d first derived from spending time with her and his wife had been replaced long ago by a gnawing urge to get on with his own life&#x2014;one that was, at the moment, on hold. <p></p> <p></p>Not that it really was, at least from a technical standpoint. The need to devote time to recovering from the wounds that he&#x2019;d received during that sharp engagement with Abu Sayyaf insurgents in the Philippines was as much a part of his chosen profession as the training he&#x2019;d put his ranger company through in preparation for that fight. Such logic, of course, did nothing to dispel a growing unease that left Nathan wondering if he&#x2019;d ever be fit, physically or mentally, to lead men into combat once more. That was, of course, provided he chose to continue with a military career, a question he found himself brooding over more and more with each passing day. <p></p> <p></p>Noticing her son&#x2019;s expression, Jan realized that she&#x2019;d reached the point in their idle chat where she&#x2019;d lost his attention. Pausing with a half eaten English muffin halfway to her mouth, Jan smiled. "So, what&#x2019;s on your agenda today? Another round of physical therapy?" <p></p> <p></p>Caught off guard by his mother&#x2019;s question, Nathan shook his head as if to clear his thoughts. "Ah, no. Not today. I had to reschedule that till Wednesday." <p></p> <p></p>"Well then," Jan continued without bothering to dissect Nathan&#x2019;s wary response, "anything exciting planned?" <p></p> <p></p>Finding himself backed into a corner and knowing full well that he couldn&#x2019;t possibly keep Jan from finding out one way or another, Nathan decided it was time to come clean with her. "I have an appointment this morning in Arlington." <p></p> <p></p>Taken aback by her son&#x2019;s announcement, Jan stopped what she was doing, folding her arms on the table as she leaned forward. Recalling Scott&#x2019;s habit of casually slipping ominous news into the midst of an otherwise innocent conversation, all sorts of possibilities began to romp through her fertile imagination, none of which were very promising. <p></p> <p></p>Recognizing the expression on his mother&#x2019;s face, Nathan realized that this was no time for prevarication. Like it or not, he was committed. The sooner he told her the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, the better. At least, that was the theory. "I received a call from General Stevens&#x2019;s office last Friday," he said, doing his best to fob her off by acting as if it had been nothing out of the ordinary. "He wants to see me." <p></p> <p></p>Jan, of course, knew better. "And what, pray tell, did the good general want?" she asked, making no effort to mask her growing concern. <p></p> <p></p>"Not sure. I only spoke to his executive officer, a colonel by the name of Kaplan who didn&#x2019;t seem to know what his boss wanted to see me about." <p></p> <p></p>"Stevens wasn&#x2019;t exactly on the best of terms with your father," Jan stated in an even tone. "It seems they were in opposing camps on some very important issues&#x2014; particularly what the Army would look like in the future." <p></p> <p></p>Not having given the matter any serious thought over the weekend, Nathan took a moment to think before responding to his mother. "Dad never discussed such things with me," he responded glumly. "He didn&#x2019;t think it was appropriate that he should discuss the opinions of other senior officers with me, especially when he didn&#x2019;t agree with them. Of course, when it came to someone like Stevens, he really didn&#x2019;t need to do so. Everyone knows Stevens is very much a technocrat, an officer who&#x2019;s staked his reputation on force modernization based on automation. Dad&#x2019;s focus, on the other hand, is always squarely on the soldier, the human factor in warfare as he likes to call it." <p></p> <p></p>Tactfully Jan ignored her son&#x2019;s use of the word "is" as opposed to "was" when referring to Scott. "Stevens is the new Chief of Staff of the Army, isn&#x2019;t he?" she asked, doing her best to keep the conversation moving forward before Nathan realized his mistake. <p></p> <p></p>"As of the first of this month. Prior to that he was C-in-C Southwest Asia." <p></p> <p></p>After a pause, Jan frowned, shaking her head as she dismissed another unsolicited and very troubling thought that popped up in the back of her min...</p><h2>Tiki Style</h2><p>This enlightening and hilarious guide casts the reader as an &#34;&#34;urban archaeologist,&#34;&#34; exploring the lost remnants of the Tiki culture across the United States and discovering relics from this forgotten civilization in thrift stores, yard sales, and used book and record emporia.

We were given to understand that Dad was a man of many talents, but none we knew of was so great as his gift for disappearing. All our lives he would leave without saying when he would be back. It could be days or weeks or months. Long enough that just when you thought this time he wouldn&#x2019;t return, he did. Without warning, unburdened by guilt or explanations. But now he&#x2019;d gone somewhere there was no coming back from, and it was almost disappointing, the end of his mysterious life coming not by way of stunning revelations or secret agents knocking at the door but the inevitable way it comes for all of us.<br> <br>Less than an hour after I got off the phone with Mom, a woman called saying she was &#x201c;a representative of your father&#x2019;s estate&#x201d; and that a car would come first thing in the morning to pick me up. When I asked where this car would take me, I was told it would be a journey requiring a day away, the destination &#x201c;necessarily confidential.&#x201d;<br> <br>That &#x201c;necessarily&#x201d; irked me. A word my father would use to answer why he couldn&#x2019;t say where he went. It implied we should appreciate the complicated circumstances behind things having to be this way, his importance, the triviality of our need to understand.<br> <br>You&#x2019;ll never tell us where you go, will you? I asked him once, though what I really wanted to know was if he ever missed us when he was gone.<br> <br>No, Aaron. I&#x2019;m afraid I won&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Because it&#x2019;s a secret?<br> <br>Yes, he answered sadly. A sadness for me, his tone made clear, not something he felt himself. Necessarily so.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>The limo stops before I can ask Bridge more about her being here before. The driver pulls open the back door and speaks for the first time since we started out this morning, asking for our cell phones.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do you want them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Protocol,&#x201d; he mumbles, the accent hinting at Russian, his fat palm thrust a little too close to my face.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do we do?&#x201d; Bridge asks me.<br> <br>&#x201c;You expecting any important calls in the next hour?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me neither. So let&#x2019;s humor them and play by the rules.&#x201d;<br> <br>We hand our phones over to the driver, who sticks them in the pocket of his blazer and, without another word, returns to sit in the front seat, leaving us to get out. He eases the limo away to park next to another just like it at the edge of a circular gravel area outside what must be the castle Dad spoke of in his stories.<br> <br>What&#x2019;s the best word to describe it? Not &#x201c;castle,&#x201d; certainly. Not &#x201c;mansion&#x201d; either, or &#x201c;home&#x201d; or &#x201c;cabin&#x201d; or &#x201c;hotel.&#x201d; My mind can&#x2019;t stop thinking of it as a lodge, despite its enormity, the stateliness of its clean-lined, modernist construction. It&#x2019;s the walls made from whole redwood logs that does it. Flat-roofed and maybe a little more than a hundred and fifty feet wide, with a facade that consists of a single floor with few windows, the structure&#x2019;s main features are the oversized front door with its polished brass knob and Frank Lloyd Wright&#x2013;inspired metalwork of the railings. It&#x2019;s a building that communicates its expense through its extraordinary natural materials in place of ostentatious grandeur.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do we go inside?&#x201d; Bridge asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really want to.&#x201d;<br> <br>This is out before I can prevent it, and I can see how it troubles Bridge. How she doesn&#x2019;t want to enter either. She&#x2019;s fourteen, and I&#x2019;m twenty-two years older. A gap so wide you might assume we aren&#x2019;t close, but we are. We&#x2019;ve made a point of it. My job is to be her dad-in-place-of-a-dad, offering advice on the rare occasions she asks for it, and her job is to make me feel like I&#x2019;m not alone in the world.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s explore a bit,&#x201d; I add, as casually as I can.<br> <br>&#x201c;Which way?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one who&#x2019;s been here before. You pick.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bridge looks around. We both do. There&#x2019;s a utility building off to the right at the edge of the trees where I assume the tools and maintenance machinery is kept, though there are no windows to look through to confirm this. I also note how its single door is padlocked.<br> <br>On either side of the parking area are a number of trailheads leading off into the trees in different directions. Four in total, each with a small sign on a metal post. I have to squint to read the words: Red, Green, Yellow, Orange. The kind of generic route names you&#x2019;d find on a corporate campus. I try to peer along the trails to see where they lead, but each of them, after a couple dozen yards, takes a turn and disappears into the uninterrupted woods.<br> <br>&#x201c;How about Green?&#x201d; Bridge says.<br> <br>We start toward the closest trailhead to our right. The trees seem to grow closer together as we approach, forcing our lines of sight to press into the spaces between their trunks only to be stopped by the trees behind them, again and again. It makes me think of looking into a mirror reflected in a second mirror, so that the image within the glass repeats itself into a bending, infinite curve.<br> <br>&#x201c;You first,&#x201d; Bridge tells me, nudging my back with her elbow.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s meant to be funny, and we both force out a laugh, but neither of us move.<br> <br>A memory has come at me so hard I feel it as a punch to the top of my chest, a fist that passes through skin, grasping and cold.<br> <br>There seems to be little pattern to what brings it back. The forest, in this case. One that makes me remember a different forest. The men who emerged out of it, whooping and calling out names in a language I didn&#x2019;t understand. The blades they swung over their heads, catching winks of the sun.<br> <br>A buried piece of a different life.<br> <br>Overseas.<br> <br>I force myself to go forward. Two steps into the trees.<br> <br>&#x201c;You hear that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bridge doesn&#x2019;t answer, only pivots to look in the direction the sound came from. Movement through the trees. Sleek and dark and coming fast.<br> <br>&#x201c;Another car,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>We watch it ease to a stop in front of the lodge, the driver opening the back door and extending his hand for the passenger&#x2019;s phone just as ours had done. A second later our mother steps out.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; Bridge shouts, and runs off. There&#x2019;s a strange dawning of recognition on Mom&#x2019;s face as she watches her daughter come and throw her arms around her as if they&#x2019;d been separated by an absence of years instead of hours.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m about to make my way to join them when the hushed woods are interrupted by another sound. Not a car this time. A shuffling approach on the trail we were about to start on.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a temptation to pretend I hadn&#x2019;t heard it and run off as Bridge had. But my mother and little sister are here, and I&#x2019;m the eldest son. Despite my fear, despite the memory of overseas, there is this&#x2014;what I am in the family: the surgeon, stable and mature, committed to helping others. I can&#x2019;t run even if it&#x2019;s what I want to do more than anything else.<br> <br>I have to tell myself all this in order to turn and look.<br> <br>A figure makes its way toward me. Coming up a slope so that first its head, then its shoulders and legs become visible like a body rising up out of the ground. A woman. Gangly and slight, her arms flapping birdishly out from her sides.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aaron!&#x201d;<br> <br>She sounds different from when I last spoke to her, though that was almost a year ago, at Nate&#x2019;s funeral. Her son. Yet I can still recognize the scratchy, sarcastic tone as Franny&#x2019;s. My other sister, though the truth is I&#x2019;ve never really thought of her that way. She was always something else before that. A phone call from the emergency room or police station in the middle of the night. A poisonous fog I tried to stay ahead of. Most of the time growing up it was like Franny was only waiting until she could move out and get into truly serious trouble.<br> <br>Now here she is, a year younger than me but looking a dozen years older, half jogging my way in the ungainly, loping manner of someone whose legs are asleep.<br> <br>&#x201c;You beat us here,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;I went for a walk. But I got spooked out there all on my own. That&#x2019;s a lot of trees. Too much nothing for this city girl.&#x201d; She glances over my shoulder. &#x201c;Is that Mom?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She just pulled in.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, the gang&#x2019;s all here then.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Some gang.&#x201d;<br> <br>Franny stands a few feet farther from me than she ought to. Taking me in. Comparing the man in front of her to the profile of me she&#x2019;d framed in her mind. How long would she have to go back into her years of hustling and needles to find a picture she could recall in any detail?<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d say &#x2018;Sorry about Dad,&#x2019; but I&#x2019;m not sure what that really means,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;It means he&#x2019;s gone. Even more than he was when he was alive.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That pretty much nails it.&#x201d;<br> <br>She takes a half step closer to me. &#x201c;Before we go inside, it&#x2019;s important for me&#x2014; I want you to know something, Aaron.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m different now.&#x201d;<br> <br>She searches my face for doubt. And I try to hide it. To not show, through some involuntary grimace or narrowed eyes, how many times I&#x2019;ve heard this before from her. Sometimes through tears, sometimes in furious accusation, though mostly conveyed with the same stony conviction she speaks with now. It&#x2019;s convincing. As convincing as it was five years ago when she told me she was pregnant, and during the days in and out of rehab after Nate was born.<br> <br>For almost her entire adult life, being an addict has been Franny&#x2019;s sole occupation. I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;d correct me about the past tense. Even recovered addicts are still addicts, the disease in remission but never wholly erased. I&#x2019;m a doctor; I know I&#x2019;m supposed to embrace this understanding of why people&#x2014;why my sister&#x2014;would devote herself to her own destruction from the first day she sneaked a twenty from our mother&#x2019;s purse. It wasn&#x2019;t a lack of will, not a flaw of character, but the bad luck of having contracted a virus. And as a disease is never asked for, it has the power to excuse all cruelties and neglect committed along the way.<br> <br>But the truth is, I can&#x2019;t talk myself out of seeing Franny the same way I see myself. An escape artist. I ran from my life, and she did too, if only figuratively, following a trail of fixes instead of twenty-six-mile courses through the streets of different cities.<br> <br>In both cases, you collapse at the end.<br> <br>In both cases, you finish where you started.<br> <br>And now here Franny is telling me she&#x2019;s broken the cycle. Underweight and with a twitchy uncertainty to the way she shapes her face, as if constantly adjusting an emotional dial between dead and insane, searching for the human midpoint. But not stoned. Her words clear and firm even if the rest of her isn&#x2019;t. And as for making a change, I should know it&#x2019;s possible. I did it for Bridge. Maybe Franny has done it as a memorial to her own child.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m on a new path,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m not talking about all the stuff that&#x2019;s happened with the government and the police and the camps&#x2014;that&#x2019;s made it different for all of us. I&#x2019;m talking about me. A new direction.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can see that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you can&#x2019;t. Because it&#x2019;s not on the outside, not something you can see. It&#x2019;s not just that I&#x2019;m sober now. And it&#x2019;s not only about losing Nate. It&#x2019;s me. I&#x2019;ve turned things around. I work in a shelter now, did you know that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think Mom mentioned something.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Doing good work in a bad place.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s great, Franny. Really.&#x201d;<br> <br>But she doesn&#x2019;t want to hear my words of support. This, it&#x2019;s clear by her rigid jaw and hands gripped into pale-knuckled fists, is a prepared speech that must be spoken aloud, regardless of the audience. She&#x2019;s doing it to hold herself together, to prove that she is inching beyond the range of grief, that she can exist here in what remains of our father&#x2019;s shadow.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever happens today&#x2014;whatever Dad left for us&#x2014;I&#x2019;m giving it to the shelter. That&#x2019;s the only reason I&#x2019;ve come. I&#x2019;m going to pick up my check, get right back into that limo, and do something positive with what I have.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I believe you,&#x201d; I say. And I do.<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t attest to whether or not my sister will go back to using once she returns to the city, but I&#x2019;m certain she will do this. I know what it&#x2019;s like to make a sharp turn, to give shape to life by way of one big move. After that, however, all bets are off.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to see you, big brother,&#x201d; she says, and surprises me by wrapping her scrawny arms around my neck and pulling in close. She smells of lemony soap and coconut hair conditioner and lilac body spray. She smells clean.</p><h2>70 Essential Chinese Herbal Formulas</h2><p>At TCM colleges in China, undergraduates learn a basic repertoire of between 50 and 100 herbal formulas. This includes one or two formulas from each of 21 major categories. By learning to modify this core group of formulas with additions and subtractions, one will have a basic repertoire of formulas for most clinical occasions.

From the age of 14, Bob had three main areas of interest: writing/reading, philosophy, and biology. He attended Newark Academy and then Middlebury College where he earned a B.A. degree. His major in college was American Literature. In 1969, Bob went to India and Nepal to become a Buddhist yogi. He became the student of a family of Nyingmapa lamas headed by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche, the Ven. Jetsun Pema Rinpoche, and Sonam Kazi. When the Kazi family moved to New York City, Bob followed them at their request to continue his Buddhist training. Bob continued his Buddhist studies for 18 years, receiving oral transmissions, teachings, and empowerment from a number of Nyingmapa lamas, the last of which was Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche. He held various positions within the Nyingma hierarchy, including chopon (master of ceremonies), omdze (cantor), and lopon (teacher), and spent considerable time in solitary retreat. During this time, Bob also studied Tibetan medicine with such Lama doctors as Ven. Trogawa Rinpoche and Chagdud Tulku. <p>Because Bob could not see a clear path in the mid-1970s to becoming a Tibetan doctor, he decided to study its closest kin or cousin, Chinese medicine. President Nixon had reopened the United States' relationship with the People's Republic of China and James Reston had created a groundswell of interest in acupuncture with his articles about that subject in The New York Times. At that time, Bob knew of only one American acupuncture school, the New England School of Acupuncture. Before enrolling in their program, however, he decided to first study massage therapy in preparation for studying acupuncture. Therefore, in 1977, Bob moved to Boulder, CO to attend the Boulder School of Massage Therapy, which he graduated from in 1978. </p><p>At the same time, he began studying with another New York Nyingmapa who had moved to Colorado, Jerry Gardner. Jerry was a lifelong student and teacher of martial arts. In particular, Bob sought out Jerry's advice about ways of training the qi in his hands. So Bob started practicing various types of qi gong culled from a number of different styles of martial arts taught by Sifu Gardner. These included wing chun, tai ji quan, ba gua, and tai ji chi (tai ji ruler). Because of his previous many years of meditation and yogi practice, Bob quickly made progress in qi gong, and, after graduating from BSMT, opened the first qi gong school in the United States to operate outside of a martial arts context. This was the Blue Poppy Chi Kung Association. It was dedicated to teaching qi gong for health and healing purposes. In 1978, Bob invited Lucjan Shila, to teach for Blue Poppy. Lucjan was yet another New York Nyingmapa who had also studied and taught tai ji quan, xing yi, ba gua, and xi zang mi zong lama pai (Tibetan secret sect lama system, also known as Tibetan White Crane gong fu). Bob continued his qi gong studies with Lucjan, taking various qi gong exercises from the martial arts Lucjan taught. </p><p>In 1978, Bob became engaged to Honora Lee Wolfe, the founder and director of the Boulder School of Massage Therapy. This engagement effectively put an end to Bob's plans of attending the New England School of Acupuncture in Boston, MA. Therefore, he began studying acupuncture with Eric Tao (Xi-yu) in Denver, CO. Dr. Tao had learned the Tao family style of acupuncture from his uncle in Beijing when he was a teenager. After 1949, Dr. Tao and his family were forced to move to Taiwan due to their Guo Min Tang affiliation. There, Dr. Tao decided to make acupuncture his profession, and during the 1950, 60s, and early 70s became associated with Wu Wei-ping and his circle. Bob studied with Dr. Tao for a year and became certified by Dr. Tao in acupuncture-moxibustion. At the same time, Bob studied acupuncture and Chinese medicine whenever and wherever possible. This largely meant correspondence courses put out by the Occident</p></p><h2>Git Along, Old Scudder</h2><p>Old Scudder, traveling through the West with his dog Pilgrim, can&#39;t tell where he is until he draws a map and names the places on it.</p><p></p><h2>Lloyd Kiva New: A New Century</h2><p>This catalogue commemorates the life of Lloyd Kiva New, artist, fashion designer, and renowned arts educator.

H. Lawrence and H. D., excelled as the impresario for the &#x201c;new poetry&#x201d; that became news across the U. S. in the years after World War I. Maligned by T. S. Eliot as the &#x201c;demon saleswoman&#x201d; of poetry, and ridiculed by Ezra Pound, Lowell has been treated by previous biographers as an obese, sex-starved, inferior poet who smoked cigars and made a spectacle of herself, canvassing the country on lecture tours that drew crowds in the hundreds for her electrifying performances. <br><br>In fact, Lowell wrote some of the finest love lyrics of the 20th century and led a full and loving life with her constant companion, the retired actress Ada Russell. She was awarded the Pulitzer Prize posthumously in 1926. This provocative new biography, the first in forty years, restores Amy Lowell to her full humanity in an era that, at last, is beginning to appreciate the contributions of gays and lesbians to American&#x2019;s cultural heritage. Drawing on newly discovered letters and papers, Rollyson&#x2019;s biography finally gives this vibrant poet her due.</p><p>Carl Rollyson is a professor of journalism at Baruch College, The City University of New York. Rollyson has published more than forty books, including American Isis: The Life and Art of Sylvia Plath and Hollywood Enigma: Dana Andrews. His articles and reviews have appeared in The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Minneapolis Star Tribune, The Raleigh News &amp; Observer, The Kansas City Star, The Barnes &amp; Noble Review, and The New Criterion. Visit his website: www.carlrollyson.com.'God made me a business woman,' Amy Lowell said, 'and I made myself a poet.' Since Jean Gould's Amy: The World of Amy Lowell and the Imagist Movement (CH, Mar'76), biographers have often focused on the poet's sexuality. This aspect of her life in relation to her poetry is addressed in Amy Lowell, American Modern, ed. by Adrienne Munich and Melissa Bradshaw (CH, Sep'04, 42-0146). Rollyson (Baruch) employs it to present Lowell as a maverick. . . . For Rollyson, Lowell's wealth was a source of authority with promoters and conflict with fellow poets. She was a strong-willed but somewhat isolated character, beset by 'enemies' and most vulnerable in her secretive relationships with younger women. There is little psychological or literary analysis, and one is left to wonder about Lowell's obsession with John Keats, her interest in classical themes, and her nuanced relationship with Ezra Pound. Clearly ambiguous (and rare) moments of feminist conviction in poems like 'The Sisters' are trotted out without explication. The volume is light, but engaging and readable. Summing Up: Recommended. . . . General readers. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>For all of Carl Rollyson's impressive original research, Amy Lowell Anew is. . . an accessible introduction to its subject, which should do much to bring readers to this remarkable poet's work. (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>Rollyson has added a new book, Amy Lowell Anew, which delves. . . . into the interplay between Lowell's personal and professional lives. Rollyson had access to the extensive Lowell archive at Harvard University as well as resources in England. And he got help from a few archivists who located new sources, notably an archivist at the Massachusetts Historical Society who found a group of letters referring to a hitherto unknown female companion. ... The biography gives Amy Lowell her own place in the literary canon, even if it is a minor one&#x2014;minor in part because of her early death, but also because her surviving partner chose to remain silent about their relationship. Rollyson put this relationship front and center to Lowell's most passionate works: her erotic poetry and her biography of Keats. (<i>Gay and Lesbian Review</i>)<br><br>No husband, no babies, no Victorian prudery, just sublime poetry and a secret erotic life. Amy Lowell was not what we thought she was. (Marion Meade, author of Dorothy Parker: What Fresh Hell Is This?)<br><br>Informed by newly recovered personal accounts of Amy Lowell, Rollyson presents the growth of a poet who embraced and furthered imagism and unabashedly celebrated the body in love. He follows Lowell in her performances on the road and traces her lifelong interest in Asian culture. His abundant experience as a biographer allows Rollyson to offer a keen appreciation of Lowell&#x2019;s own biography of Keats, to assess the sources of negative biographies and impressions of her, and to support the recent current of feminist recuperation of Lowell&#x2019;s life and work. (Bonnie Kime Scott, professor emerita, San Diego State University and the University of Delaware)<br><br>Amy Lowell Anew deserves all the prizes. It is a major work of American cultural history, restoring to readers a poet of great distinction and a public figure of immense importance to American letters and our 20th Century history. Carl Rollyson is a hero of a biographer for his rescue and rethinking the lives of many neglected or misunderstood women. His approach has always been to treat his figures with dignity and respect. Dignity and respect have been sorely lacking in works about Amy Lowell. Recently, lesbian scholars have recreated Lowell as a grand dame diva, a great leap forward. Now Rollyson moves painstakingly through the life and works, not only writing/righting wrongs but carefully resettling Amy Lowell's poetry into the American canon where it belongs. His study of her role as public speaker and cultural advocate for poetry give us at last Amy Lowell as a Public Intellectual. (Jane Marcus, distinguished professor of English and Women's Studies, CUNY Graduate Center and the City College of New York)<br><br>This is the biography I've been waiting for. Carl Rollyson has exhaustively mined Lowell's archive to create a thoughtful portrait of a complicated, ambitious artist. Here, beyond the legends, the rumors, and the facile aspersions that her larger-than-life persona inspired is a woman I've wanted to meet for a very long time. (Melissa Bradshaw, author of Amy Lowell, Diva Poet)<br><br>Treated as the butt of jokes by her male modernist contemporaries and by hostile biographers, Amy Lowell has been rescued from decades of homophobia, sexism, and anti-fat prejudice by this brilliant new study. Carl Rollyson turns archival research into exciting storytelling, as he brings Lowell and her passionate relationships with her lovers out of the shadows, while demonstrating why the popularity once enjoyed both by her poetry, which infuses domestic situations with eroticism and with a political consciousness, and by her public performances of it was no fluke.

The Ferdinand was a true behemoth, and although only 91 examples were built, they took a savage toll of Soviet armor in the Battle of Kursk and subsequent operations on the Eastern Front. This study explores the technical development and combat deployment of this remarkable vehicle, from its origins in the Porsche Tiger Tank through its deployment under the designation &#39;Ferdinand&#39; in the Citadel offensive, to its modification and redesignation as the &#39;Elefant&#39; and final use in the desperate Battle of Berlin. Drawing on original archival material from within Germany, private collections, and heretofore unpublished photographs this title is an essential illustrated history to one of the most famous armored vehicles ever built.</p><p>A German national, Thomas Anderson is a specialist in the German armored fighting vehicle of World War II.

Of devastation. The unmentionable is love, of course. But in Moure&#x2019;s poems, love is bound to a duty: to comprehend what it was that the immigrants would not speak of. Now they are dead; their children and grandchildren know but an anecdotal pastiche of Ukrainian history. On Saskatoon Mountain in Alberta where they settled, only the chatter of the leaves remains of their presence. What was not spoken is sealed over, unmemntioable.

The Red Sox, after winning the 2004 World Series to cap what will go down as the most famous postseason run in history, had been swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Chicago White Sox.</p><p></p><p>The immediate postmortems would center on that bases-loaded, no-outs jam the White Sox had wriggled out of in the sixth inning, but the air had been let out of the Red Sox's game, and their season, an inning earlier. In the bottom of the fifth, designated hitter David Ortiz came up with two men on and two men out. As he lumbered toward the plate at Fenway, Ortiz was busy mulling over his previous at-bat, when he had finally put the Red Sox on the board with a towering home run to straightaway center field. Now, with the score tied 2-2, the Fenway crowd began to scream in unison as Ortiz made his deliberate, heaving journey to the batter's box: "M-V-P! M-V-P!" It was as if the crowd felt it could will the country's sportswriters into granting Ortiz the award if its cheers were loud enough.</p><p></p><p>Ortiz, who bears a passing resemblance to the cartoon movie monster Shrek, contorts his face into a menacing snarl when he's hitting; it makes him look as if he's preparing to eat the opposing pitcher for dinner. With Johnny Damon, the team's matinee idol of a center fielder, dancing off second base, his wild mane of hair flapping below his batting helmet, and Renteria edging off first, Ortiz uncoiled his mammoth arms and chased after Chicago starter Freddy Garcia's first offering. The bat hit the ball sharply -- thwack! -- and, at first, it seemed to mirror perfectly the trajectory of Ortiz's fourth inning shot. The crowd leapt to its feet with a roar. But as strong and powerful as Ortiz is, not even he can push a ball out of the deepest part of the park when he doesn't connect dead on, and his bat had gotten just under this ball. As he dashed for first, and Damon rounded third, the ball arced through the crisp Boston air and fell, finally, into Aaron Rowand's glove in center field. Inning over.</p><p></p><p>Ortiz stopped about 20 feet from first base and froze, staring blankly at the spot where his blast had died. He stayed there as the White Sox jogged off the field. He stayed there as his teammates began taking their defensive positions around him. It was as if he couldn't believe that this time, in this at-bat, he hadn't been able to come through. The Red Sox had to win this game . . . didn't they? They had all the trappings of a championship team, including a $127 million payroll, the second highest in baseball. (The Yankees, the perennial bullies down the block, led the field at $208 million.) They had a roster full of All-Stars: Manny Ramirez, the slugging left fielder who was often described as the best right-handed hitter in the American League; Jason Varitek, the unassuming catcher who was known as one of the premier pitch-callers in baseball; and, of course, Damon and Ortiz. They had what was commonly described as the smartest front office in the business and an ownership group that seemed as devoted to fielding a winning team and giving back to the community as it was to making money. It was a recipe that was supposed to all but ensure success.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, since Henry, Werner, and Lucchino had taken over, being a Boston Red Sox fan, once a pastime best suited to masochists and depressives, had become fun, exciting, even trendy. Henry, the shy commodities trader, brought the same faith in statistical analysis to his baseball team that he did to his work in the markets. Werner, the television executive responsible for hits like <i>The Cosby Show</i> and <i>Roseanne</i>, helped ensure that the Red Sox's regional sports network, the New England Sports Network (NESN), raked in revenue. And Lucchino, the hard-charging former litigator, was an uncommonly creative chief executive known for never resting on his laurels and having a keen eye for emerging front-office talent. He delighted in fostering and developing smart, young leaders, most notably Theo Epstein, the 31-year-old Bostonian who became a folk hero when he was named the team's general manager before the 2003 season.</p><p></p><p>Together, Henry, Werner, and Lucchino had taken an organization known primarily for its heartbreaking losses and perennial runner-up status and transformed it into a world champion. Gone were the days when the team failed to sign Jackie Robinson or Willie Mays because its owner and its general manager were racists. Gone were the days when Carlton Fisk, a New England native and one of the best catchers ever to play the game, was lost to free agency because the Red Sox front office neglected to mail him his contract on time. Gone were the days of owners not speaking to management, of management not speaking to the coaching staff, of the coaching staff not speaking to the players. Gone was the Curse of the Bambino, the specter of Bucky F-ing Dent and Billy Buckner. Even the notoriously combative Boston media seemed to have been pacified by the team's press-friendly policies and winning ways. The Red Sox of old might have fielded a team of whining, overpaid misfits who got swept in the first round, and in the old days, that sort of failure would be followed by a course of inevitable finger-pointing and recriminations, whether deserved or not. But that wouldn't happen now. These days, things were different.</p><p></p><p>Weren't they?</p><p></p><p></p><p>It had been just five years earlier, on October 6, 2000, that John Harrington, then chief executive officer of the Red Sox, announced that, for the first time in a generation, the team was up for sale. Harrington was the last direct link to Tom Yawkey, the millionaire playboy who bought the Red Sox in 1933, and whose name now graced Yawkey Way, the street on which the entrance to Fenway Park's offices were located. Yawkey died in 1976; his wife, Jean, helped run the team until her death in 1992, at which point Harrington, one of Jean Yawkey's closest confidants, took control of the Jean R. Yawkey Trust, which by 1994 owned a majority stake in the team.</p><p></p><p>At first, the timing of Harrington's announcement seemed odd. The Red Sox had just emerged victorious from a grueling legislative battle that all but guaranteed the construction of a new, modern ballpark to replace Fenway, the oldest, smallest, and least comfortable place to watch a ball game in the whole country. But Jean Yawkey's will had compelled the trust to put the team up for sale eventually (the profits would be used to endow the charitable Yawkey Foundations), and the Red Sox's value was at an all-time high. Attendance was up, baseball had recovered from the labor dispute that had led to the strike that canceled the 1994 World Series, and the Red Sox were stocked with exciting, top-tier talent, including pitching great Pedro Martinez and homegrown superstar shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. In the press conference announcing the sale, Harrington said that, above all else, he hoped the team would go to a local bidder. "God willing," Harrington said, "my last act will be to turn this incredible team over to a die-hard Red Sox fan from New England who knows how important the team is to this town and the fabric of this community." In an article the next day, <i>The Boston Globe</i> noted that Harrington would, of course, be willing to listen to bids from outsiders.</p><p></p><p>The journey that began that day would continue for another 14 months. The sale of Major League Baseball teams is a notoriously Byzantine and time-consuming process; after the seller finds a buyer and the two agree on a price, the new owner still must be approved by three-fourths of MLB's 30 owners. Baseball commissioner Allan H. "Bud" Selig is perpetually rumored to fix this or that deal to help his cronies or allies end up with the winning bid. In Boston's case, the sale was even weirder than usual: The intense emotional hold the Red Sox have over the New England populace meant the entire region, from sportswriters to politicians, was strongly predisposed to a local group buying the team, whether or not it was willing to put up the money to do so. For much of 2001, the <i>Boston Herald</i> (and to a lesser extent, the <i>Globe</i>), unabashedly promoted the bid of Joe O'Donnell and Steve Karp, a pair of local businessmen who seemed to be friends or business associates with virtually every power broker in the city. Tom Werner, who had teamed up with Les Otten, a controversial New England ski entrepreneur, was seen as a long shot. And John Henry, who spent much of 2001 trying to get a new stadium built for the Florida Marlins, the Miami-based team he had bought in 1998, didn't even enter the fray until November, just weeks before final bids for the Red Sox were due.</p><p></p><p>Yet, on December 20, 2001, Henry, Werner, and Lucchino were awarded the team. Within days, word had it that the sale had been a fix, a bag job, orchestrated by Selig and perpetrated by Harrington and Red Sox lawyers. Advanced by Massachusetts attorney general Tom Reilly and rabidly propagated by the <i>Herald</i> (as well as <i>Globe</i> sports columnists Dan Shaughnessy and Will McDonough), the notion spread. For years, any discussion of the Henry ownership group would include some sort of caveat about the rigged sale of the team. Over time, this notion began to calcify -- the transformation of myth into accepted reality is an essential motif in the Red Sox's history -- and eventually the new owners more or less stopped trying to correct the record.</p><p></p><p>The unconcealed bitterness and acrimony that greeted Henry and Werner when they arrived in Boston was only part of the problem the new owners faced. In the yea...</p></p><h2>The Worst Weather on Earth: A History of Mount Washington Observatory</h2><p>From the front flap of this 265 page book: &#34;&#39;There may be worse weather, from time to time, at some forbidding place on Planet Earth, but it has yet to be reliably recorded&#39;. So begins &#39;The Worst Weather on Earth: A History of the Mount Washington Observatory&#39;. Mount Washington, at 6,288 feet above sea level, is one of the highest elevations in the eastern United States and is subject to some of the fiercest weather patterns in the world. Situated close to major centers of population, it has been an accessible objective for travellers. The curious, the intrepid, the scientific: Mount Washington has attracted them all. In this age of satellites and advanced instrumentation, the intricacies of weather observation are now taken for granted. However, not so long ago, weather was a blank on the scientific map of understanding. [This book] chronicles the social and scientific milieu of those who have recorded the weather on the mountain for over one hundred years. Included are chapters such as &#39;Radio on the Rockpile&#39;, which covers the pioneering days of radio broadcasting from the Summit, and &#39;Rime and Reason&#39;, which presents a fascinating discussion of rime and the problems of icing that were researched extensively on the Summit. &#39;The Worst Weather on Earth&#39; is rendered more immediate by the liberal use of contemporary accounts: excerpts from letters, reports, and the log notes of the Summit observers abound, giving the flavor and the excitement of over a century of scientific and observation and discovery.&#34; Also included with the descriptive text are many black and white photos of the mountain, the observatory and many of the people who have worked on the mountain and climbed it.</p><p></p><h2>Paul Klee (Getting to Know the World&#39;s Greatest Artists)</h2><p>Discusses the life and work of the abstract painter, focusing on his use of color, shape, and symbolism</p><p>Mike Venezia is the author of several nonfiction books for children.&#34;The excellent-quality reproductions do a great deal to enhance and extend the text.&#34;</p><h2>The Green Hornet &#x2019;66 Meets The Spirit TP</h2><p>Another challenge for THE GREEN HORNET, his aide KATO, and their rolling arsenal, THE BLACK BEAUTY!

Unlike many earlier pattern collections that relied exclusively on written instructions of the "knit one, purl one" variety, Stanfield's compilation of 332 patterns features charted patterns and close-up photographs throughout. Patterns in chart form have only recently come to be preferred by many creative knitters, perhaps because charts provide a pictorial representation of how the finished piece will actually look. Stanfield divides the collection into five major groups: knit and purl, cable, lace and bobble, twisted stitches, and "other." Throughout, she emphasizes charts, using written instructions only when introducing new material. This book has much to admire, including myriad elegant stitch patterns the author has rescued from obscurity, excellent photography, and a thumbnail index with a small photograph of each pattern linked by number to the complete pattern.

By decoding the hidden messages in appearance, tone of voice, facial expression, and personal habit, she has accurately predicted the behavior of jurors, witnesses, lawyers, and judges in some of the most celebrated trials of the past two decades. Now in this phenomenal new book, she applies the secrets of her extraordinary success to the everyday situations we all face at work, at home, and in relationships.<br><br>How can you "hear between the lines" to detect a lie? When is intuition the best guide to making important decisions? What are the tell-tale signs of romantic attraction? How do other people "read" us? The answers lie closer than we might think. Hair style, clothing, grooming, hand gestures, the neatness of office or living room, the steadiness of the gaze, behavior around subordinates: all of these provide critical clues to a person's integrity, work habits, and sexual interests. Through vivid anecdotes and proven techniques, Dimitrius teaches us how to interpret these signs with accuracy and precision.<br><br>Whether your focus is friendship or marriage, career or family, romance or professional success, Reading People&nbsp;&nbsp;gives you the skills you need to make sound, swift decisions and reap the benefits from a lifetime of razor-sharp insight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It's true that politicians blink much more frequently when they're lying, but what other behavior clues do people inadvertently give off? If you want to know if you're being boondoggled, how to tell if your date is interested in a serious relationship, or if you should take that new job, Jo-Ellan Demitrius will help you figure it all out. She gives away the tricks of her trade--jury consulting--in this eye-opening handbook for predicting the behavior and revealing the thoughts of others. She's consulted for more than 600 jury trials, including the O.J. Simpson, Rodney King, and John DuPont cases, as well as for Fortune 100 companies. If her name rings a bell, it may be because she's been on <i>Oprah</i>, <i>Larry King Live</i>, and <i>60 Minutes</i>, among other television shows. <p> Much more than a collection of tips on reading body language, her book is supremely organized, detailed, and thorough, with lists of physical characteristics, vocal patterns, office props, and conversational behaviors that reveal much more than you'd think. She instructs on how to analyze hundreds of details of everyday living, from the style of the picture frame on your boss's desk to the odd way that an acquaintance swears up a storm, in order to uncover personality traits and predict future behavior.</p><p> Demitrius isn't a hocus-pocus intuition hawker; she's more of a scientist. "...over the past fifteen years," she writes, "I have tested this method on more than ten thousand 'research subjects.' After predicting the behavior of thousands of jurors, witnesses, lawyers, and judges, I have been able to see whether my predictions came true....I did not always peg them correctly, especially in the earlier years. But by testing my perceptions over and over, I have verified which clues are generally reliable and which are not." Her advice will prove valuable not just to lawyers but to businesspeople, parents, and anyone curious about their relationships. While the book is mostly aimed at deconstructing the behavior and characteristics of others, it's also useful for job candidates and anyone concerned with projecting the appropriate image. <i>-- Erica Jorgensen</i></p>Can you imagine how much better your life choices would be if you knew how to "read" people, predict their behavior, and understand how they're "reading" you?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading People will open your eyes to a wealth of clues that reveal the truth about those around you.
